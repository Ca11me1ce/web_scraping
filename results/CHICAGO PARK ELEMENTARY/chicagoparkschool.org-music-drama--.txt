Music & Drama
The Chicago Park School District employs a highly qualified certificated Music Teacher to offer a variety of Performing Arts programs for grades 1-8.  Offerings include: Beginning, intermediate and advanced band for grades 4-8, and weekly classroom music for all students in grades K-5. Band classes are conducted two times a week before school, and the band room is open for drop-ins once a week at lunchtime.
In addition to the courses offered by our music instructor, the primary grade teachers do an outstanding job preparing their classes to perform a beautifully choreographed winter musical or play for the entire community.  We also bring assemblies to Chicago Park each year that are rich in music, dance and/or theater.
Students in grades TK-8 participate in the Brummitt-Taylor classical music program.  Each week they are exposed to a different classical artist such as Bach or Mozart.  Monday through Friday, classroom teachers read a snippet about the composer and then students listen to a 4-5 minute sampling of a concerto.
