Art Docent
Art Docent
All grade levels participate in an in-depth art docent program on a monthly basis.  Students are exposed to different periods of art history from all over the world, and then have opportunities to work with similar mediums to create their own masterpieces.  Docents are enthusiastic parent volunteers who have been formally trained to conduct these lessons.
