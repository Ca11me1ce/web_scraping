Volunteers
Volunteer
Parent volunteers are a big part of the culture at Chicago Park and there are many ways for you to be involved.  For the safety of our children, all parents volunteers are required to read the 
Volunteer Handbook
 and then complete and submit the included application.
In addition to time on campus, we do occasionally need drivers for field trips and other special events.  All drivers are required to complete and submit a 
Driver Certification Form
.
* Please note: regular volunteers at the school must have a current TB inoculation and fingerprint clearance from the DOJ.
