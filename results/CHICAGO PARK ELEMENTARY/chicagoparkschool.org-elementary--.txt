Elementary School
Our elementary school has been thriving for over 100 years serving K-8 grade students.  We take great pride in offering a high quality program that addresses the individual academic and social needs of our students in a safe and nurturing environment.  Small class sizes and teachers trained in differentiated curriculum make it possible to often offer individualized instructional programs.  Though we are a small school, we still offer the same extra curriculars larger schools do, including: sports, music and drama, art, and electives for middle grade students.
