Singapore Math
Singapore Math
Singapore math is a teaching method based on the national mathematics curriculum used for kindergarten through sixth grade in Singapore.  Students solve mathematical problems in an abstract way by using numbers and symbols.  Singapore Math emphasizes the development of conceptual understanding prior to the teaching of procedures.
Basic Concepts
Students explore math concepts in three stages. First is the concrete stage where students use physical objects called “manipulatives” to learn mathematical concepts. Manipulatives include things like plastic counting chips, blocks, and dice. Second is the pictorial stage where students draw pictures representing mathematical concepts. Third is the abstract stage where students use pencil and paper to solve the math problem using a formula.
There are many ways to solve a problem, and combining the concrete, the pictorial, and the abstract methods can really help us understand the ideas behind the math!
