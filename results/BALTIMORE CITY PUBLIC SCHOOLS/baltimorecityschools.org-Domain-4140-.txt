2017-2018 Forester Theme:  
"United We Stand:  One Voice - One Goal"  
Welcome to Forest Park Senior High School!  The 2017-2018 school-year, together with the members of our extended Forest Park and City Schools family, promises to deliver another year of collaboration, commemoration, and celebration of all city schools students!  
We look forward to seeing and supporting our beloved Classes of 2018, 2019, and 2020, and we WELCOME the new Freshman Class of 2021!  The Foresters are temporarily located at 6900 Park Heights Avenue, former home of our partner school Northwestern, while our home FPHS campus receives a multi-million dollar 21st Century Community School renovation!  The classes of 2019, 2020, and 2021 are projected to graduate from our new state-of-the-art 21st Century School building!  The transformation continues this year, with renovations projected to be complete August, 2018.    We are excited about our former Northwestern High School students and other new students joining our Forest Park HS Family!  
This year, we're adding ESOL, S.T.E.A.M. and Project-Based Learning (PBL) programs and clubs to our current power-packed roster of CORE, HONORS, and AP COURSES, SPORTS, AND PROGRAMS!  WE SERVE BREAKFAST, LUNCH, AND DINNER DAILY at FPHS!  Be sure to join us, for the following orientation sessions:
9th/10th Grade HS Prep Orientation (Students & Parents):  Sat. Aug. 19, 2017  10am-2pm
11th/12 Grade HS Prep Orientation (Students & Parents):  Sat. Aug. 26, 2017  10am-2pm 
In 1924, the founders of Forest Park High School established an educational standard grounded in the school's motto:  "Enter to Learn. Go Forth to Serve."  This motto symbolizes high school as the final compulsory education experience to prepare today's graduates for tomorrow's careers.  The 21st Century workforce demands graduates have exceptional knowledge, skills, training, work ethic, positive image, and character.  We invite you to support and to join us in this exciting movement!  
For All You Do to Positively Support ALL of Baltimore's Youth, Thank You!
Sincerely, 
Monica P. Dailey, Principal
