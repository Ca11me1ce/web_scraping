Dear Grove Park Parents and Community, 
Greetings and welcome to the 2017-18 school year! All staff members at  Grove Park Elementary/Middle School are thrilled to be working with you and your children.  In addition to having a robust and rigorous academic year planned, we have also planned many fun activities for students and parents.  Please note the change in our starting time for breakfast and plan accordingly; the building will now open for breakfast at 7:25 am. 
This year we are looking forward to having a thriving relationship with parents and the community.  You are encouraged to sign up to volunteer at the school or take advantage of the resources in our Parent Room.  We look forward to having an incredible and memorable school year!
