We will 
empower
 our students to take over the world by providing 
quality instruction 
in a 
nurturing environment, 
and equip students with the necessary knowledge and skills to be 
productive
 citizens in society.
We believe that:
Learning is an ongoing process that extends beyond the classroom to include family, home, and community.
Learning requires active, productive, and meaningful student engagement.
Students learn best through their 
strengths
 and in a variety of ways in a 
safe
, 
supportive
 and 
orderly
 environment
Students and families can visit 
www.baltimorecityschools.org/backtoschool
 for all they need to know about:
Transportation, including how to find out about the new BaltimoreLink routes 
What time school starts and ends
Immunization requirements
