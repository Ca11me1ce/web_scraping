________________________________________________________
I am happy to share with you that I am a recipient of 2018 Heart of the School Award!  I am being recognized because we have such a talented staff and terrific school.  The award is an acknowledgement of an amazing team effort.  There would be no award without the hard work your child’s teacher puts in every day.  
The Heart of the School program celebrates City Schools’ principals.  You can learn more about the process at: https://www.heartoftheschoolawards.org.  This year, the committee received 829 nominations for 96 principals.  There were 10 finalists and 5 award winners. I received more than 100 (very kind) nominations from parents, community members and staff.  I want to personally thank each parent for trusting HHA with the most important part of your life. HHA parents rock!   
There is a big celebration at the Hippodrome Theater Monday, May 21, 2018 from 5:30-9:30 pm that includes dinner.  An HHA parent will introduce me, there will be a video of a “day in the life” at HHA, and I will deliver brief remarks.  There is usually a very entertaining master of ceremonies to keep things moving. Tickets are a bit pricey, and it is a school night, but the evening is open to the public if you’d like to join us.  About half of our staff will be in attendance as well as my family.  Being principal of this wonderful school is the best job ever!
