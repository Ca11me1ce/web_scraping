UPCOMING EVENTS
The students will arrive and dismiss from one exit at the rear of the building in the gym. All parents will wait inside the gym for students to be dismissed. Early dismissals will only be granted up to 2:00 p.m. After 2:00 p.m., parents must remain inside the gym until the dismissal of all students. For the safety of our students, please do not double park your cars in the front of the school. There is plenty of parking on both sides of the school and this is more convenient for picking up students at dismissal. Also, it is a courtesy for our community neighbors.Our school is a UNIFORM school. All students must wear their uniforms everyday.Girls and boys must wear white tops and navy blue bottoms.
