Athletics at City Springs 
Our Scholar-Athlete School Vision
City Springs wants to improve student achievement, school attendance, and student health and wellness through athletics. Our intentions are to decrease the obesity rate and other health conditions prevalent in our population that are caused by unhealthy attitudes towards physical activity and unhealthy eating, and tie this to their existing interests in sports, as well as introducing them to new sports programs, of which they currently have no exposure. Through the coach/athlete relationship we will develop a powerful mentoring relationship that will change attitudes about school attendance, academic success, and an overall concern for taking excellent care of one’s self.
Many of our students are highly motivated to participate in athletics. We will use this desire to ensure that student achievement improves and that students set academic achievement goals and personal standards that exceed their present goals and standards.
Athletics: Part of a Well-Rounded Education
For our students who are not athletic, we will encourage them to join other activities such as debate, choir, instrumental music, Girl Scouts, leadership development programs, or drama. We will also use their motivation and mentoring relationships to promote positive attitudes about school attendance, academic success, and healthy eating and exercise.
City Springs believes that this vision of a scholar-athlete school will not only improve current personal health and wellness, culture, and academic achievement of our school, but will also have an amazing effect on the lives of our students. Their futures will be different because of our efforts. They will grow up having leadership qualities, skills, and competencies that will serve as “tickets” to college or career. They will also become healthy adults who will not contribute to the ever-growing obesity rate in this country.
To this vision, and to our students, we are committed.
