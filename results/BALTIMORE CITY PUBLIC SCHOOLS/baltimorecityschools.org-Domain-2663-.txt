Welcome
 As principal of Thomas Jefferson Elementary Middle School (TJEMS), it is my pleasure to welcome everyone back for another great school year.  We are all excited to have students back in our classrooms full of energy and enthusiasm for learning.  The scope and magnitude of our responsibilities to our students, parents, caregivers and the community are infinite.  
We believe that all children can learn and it is our job to find their individual interests to ensure they are able to apply knowledge to real life.  Our words, actions, and inactions have a profound impact on our students.  Therefore, we offer nothing less than our best every day to succeed in providing everything we can in making a difference in the lives of our students.
Welcome back! Let's have an amazing school year!
Danielle Davis, Principal
