School Profiles
Updated April 2018
School profiles present three years of schoolwide data, including assessment results, official enrollment, attendance, and suspension data, school survey results, and college and career readiness information.
For elementary and middle schools, the profiles include results from the Kindergarten Readiness Assessment (KRA) and from PARCC tests in grades 3 to 8. High school profiles include cohort graduation, dropout rates, paths to graduation (the proportion of 12th-grade students in a given year who completed graduation requirements via different pathways), results from PARCC in Algebra I and II and English 10, and cumulative High School Assessment pass rates. They also include college and career readiness measures such as PSAT, SAT, and Advanced Placement performance, and Career and Technology Education and college enrollment data.
