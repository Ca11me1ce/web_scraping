Welcome
Alexander Hamilton Elementary School #145: A Partnership School that strives for EXELLENCE!!! 
In partnership with our families and community, we are creating a culture of college readiness where everyone is a learner, everyone is a teacher, and everyone is a leader. The mission of Alexander Hamilton Elementary School #145 is to become a high performing community school that engages all students in exemplary teaching and learning experiences that are rigorous, differentiated, meaningful and memorable and take place in a safe and orderly environment.
 EXCELLENCE IS POSSIBLE!!!
"We have work to do, but not impossible work. It is a matter of focus. It is a matter of appropriate criteria. It is a matter of communication. It is a matter of collaboration. It is a matter of will."
- Asa Hilliard
Building  A Community of Learners where parents and teachers work together as partners!
