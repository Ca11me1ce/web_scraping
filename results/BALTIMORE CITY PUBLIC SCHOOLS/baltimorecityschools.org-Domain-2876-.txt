Welcome
Dear Parents/Guardians,
Welcome to another year of teaching and learning at the Prestigious Fallstaff Elementary Middle School. I trust that you are having an enjoyable summer. It will soon be time for students to return and engage in rigorous learning which will allow them to perform at high academic levels to meet the demands of the 21st century.
This year, you can look forward to encountering a highly intensive and challenging academic program that will push your child to work beyond his/her limits. However, I am confident that all of our children have the capacity and ability to meet our expectations and the demands of his/her new classes and teachers.
Our goal is to ensure that all students become critical thinkers, active problem-solvers, inquisitive readers, diligent researchers and prolific writers. We do all of this to prepare our children for the demands of the real-world as they become productive citizens, our future leaders, and positive contributor to the community.
Our Mission is To Learn. Read Today, Lead Tomorrow. The Race for Excellence Begins with a Book!
Sincerely,
Faith Hibbert, Ed.D
Principal
