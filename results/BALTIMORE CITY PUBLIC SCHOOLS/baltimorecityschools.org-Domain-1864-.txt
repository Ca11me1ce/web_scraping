Welcome
My name is Nikia P. Carter, and I am proud to serve as your principal. I believe that in order to have a successful school we must all work together to ensure that the needs of students are being met. I believe that it is everyone’s responsibility to empower children with the creative, intellectual and decision-making skills necessary for them to become academically, socially, physically, and emotionally successful , responsible and a future leader. Your participation in your child’s education is crucial to his or her success. There will be many opportunities for you to be involved, please check the calendar. I look forward to having a positive lasting relationship with you and your family.
