MORAVIA PARK ELEMENTARY COMMUNITY SCHOOL VISION
Moravia Park is a community school that celebrates its diversity by cultivating a safe, nurturing environment that prepares students to be college and career ready and productive citizens, through collaborations with the school, families, and the community. 
MORAVIA PARK'S JANUARY 2018 NEWSLETTER
Moravia Park Elementary School is a School-Wide Title I School that complies with No Child Left Behind (NCLB), hence we are committed to ensuring that all of our teachers are highly qualified.  We will work hard to recruit and retain highly qualified teachers.  Parents will be notified if their child is assigned to a teacher that does not meet the highly qualified status.  The school will also ensure that the teacher is getting the proper support to the teacher until the status has been met.
Parents may request HQ status of their child's teacher at any time.
