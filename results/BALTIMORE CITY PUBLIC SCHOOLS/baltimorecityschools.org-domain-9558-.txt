College & Career Readiness
College & Career Readiness
At City Springs Elementary/Middle School we actively promote college awareness. In fact, every grade team is named after a college athletic league, and within each league, every classroom is named after a college or university within that league. When you come to City Springs, you will see college pennants hung all around the school. On the first Thursday of every month, all staff are encouraged to wear college gear representing their alma mater or a favorite college or university.
We believe it is never too early to promote College & Career Readiness for our students! From Pre-K to 8th
 Grade, there are resources you can share with your child to lay a foundation for future success.  Below are links to some excellent websites. If you need any additional information, or would like to discuss your child’s college and career goals, please contact Krista Wible, School Counselor:
