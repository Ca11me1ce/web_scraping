Welcome
Greetings NSA Students & Families,
Welcome to the 2017-2018 school year. I look forward to returning as New Song Academy’s principal and anticipate another successful year partnering with the staff and community to ensure our students receive an unparalleled educational experience. We are embarking on a new writing journey this school year entitled Telling Our Stories. The goal is for our students to use their voice to share inspirational stories of hope and vision for a better world. I encourage you to join me in sharing your stories with our school community by volunteering throughout the school year to impart your life experience with our students. Please be on the look out for events and opportunities that will help our students to build a stronger writing presence in our school and local community.
New Song Academy strives to provide a learning experience that not only supports our students academically, but socially and emotionally. We are proud to offer a challenging educational program, a stellar performing arts program, a champion basketball team and a host of afterschool program opportunities that offer something for everyone. New Song Academy builds student leaders by incorporating strong character development building concepts throughout the school day. We are a Restorative Practices school site and we honor the treasure of developing strong relationships with our students and their families. The ultimate goal for us is to prepare our students to serve as leaders within the growing Sandtown-Winchester community and to spread their talents to change the world. We believe it is important to be connected to the school through nurturing relationships, a sense of community, and participation in outreach efforts to impact our neighborhood and families in a positive way.
Our staff recognizes the role they play in helping your children reach their full potential, and they do not take the responsibility lightly. We truly believe all students can be successful, and this belief drives the work they do on a daily basis. Parent involvement is crucial to your children’s success, and we ask that you continue to play an active role in their education. 
I am honored to lead such an outstanding school community and eagerly anticipate a rewarding and successful year. Please do not hesitate to contact me with questions, concerns, or input at any time. 
Together, we will make a difference here at New Song Academy. We are Blue Ribbon bound!
Peace & Love,
Lisa Brown
Principal, New Song Academy
