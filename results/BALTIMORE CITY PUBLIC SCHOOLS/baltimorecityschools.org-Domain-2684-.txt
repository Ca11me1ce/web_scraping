WELCOME!
Dear RPEMS families,
I am writing today to inform you that, after many years here at Roland Park Elementary/Middle School, I have decided to take a new step in my career.  Although the details of a new position are not quite final, my term as your principal will end with this school year.  I am deciding between multiple opportunities which will result in leading a different school community.  Each option allows me the chance to further develop my leadership skills and capacities and apply them to a new setting.
 I’ve spent twelve years at RPEMS beginning as a physical education teacher and I cherish every moment of our time together.  Words cannot express the gratitude that I have for this entire community.  I feel that we developed a family atmosphere over the years and saying good bye is not easy.  The connection that I feel to Roland Park is something that will never go away.  I’ve learned so much from this community of students, staff, and families and I plan to apply these learned lessons in my new setting.  My decision is simply about challenging myself in new ways and lending my skillset to another school community. 
 It’s important to me that RPEMS continues to move forward with the many initiatives put in place to ensure every child is successful.  We have a solid leadership team and involved parent base that will continue to work together to fulfill our potential.  As this year winds down and I transition to a new role, our assistant principals Ms. Carter (pre-k to grade 4), Mr. Hellerbach (grades 5 and 6), and Ms. Ferris (grades 7 and 8), or I will be available to assist you with end-of-year information and plans for next school year.  There will be several meetings with our school community beginning on Thursday, May 3rd at 6:00 pm in the multi-purpose room, where you can get answers to your questions.  I hope you will be able to attend one of these sessions.  Staff from the district office will also communicate with you throughout this spring about the process for selecting a new principal and how you can participate.
Finally, please feel free to share this information with your child.  I will be interacting with students over the next few weeks to speak to them directly. 
 Sincerely,
  Nicholas D’Ambrosio
Principal
Roland Park elementary/Middle School
