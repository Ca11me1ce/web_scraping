            Building a Library at Home        
The First Annual City Springs Book Fair
Did you know that a child with books in their home will be more likely to perform well in school? 
Studies show
 that the more books a student has in their home, the more likely they are to read on their own, which will increase their academic achievement in the classroom. In other words, books matter!
City Springs’ library media specialist Ms. Rodowsky knows the importance of putting books in kids’ hands, and she encourages our students to check out and take books home from our school library whenever they want. To further her goal of fostering a love of reading, Ms. Rodowsky recently hosted the Scholastic Book Fair, inviting students in grades pre-kindergarten through 8th to peruse and purchase a large selection of fun and informative books. For a week in March, the library was transformed into a one-stop bookstore with hundreds of story books, graphic novels, and young adult titles. Students arrived in small groups during their resource classes and, after selecting books, brought money the next day to make the book their own.
Our first annual book fair proved to be a success: students purchased over $5,000 worth of books! Even better, City Springs gets to keep $1,300 of the total, and the money will be used to buy even more books for our school library. Special thanks go to two community partners, CareFirst and the Johns Hopkins Carey Business School, for making generous donations so more students could receive books. Our students are excited to build their at-home library, and they can’t wait for the book fair next year!
