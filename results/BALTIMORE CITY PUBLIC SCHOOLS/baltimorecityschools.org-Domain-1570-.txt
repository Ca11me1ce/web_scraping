Welcome to the 2017-2018 School Year!
 We welcome back our returning families as well as extend a warm welcome to our new families that are joining us. 
There will be many exciting things happening this year. We are counting down the days until we will move back home to our brand new building. If you haven't passed by 621 Wildwood Parkway in a while, it has undergone a significant change. We are so fortunate to have been selected as one of the first schools to be renovated under the district's 21st Century Buildings Program. Construction will be complete in time for students to return after Winter Break.
This year we are also adding sixth grade in preparation for our transition to a full middle school. We are excited to continue to teach some of the brightest minds in Baltimore. We know that they will do great things in the coming years as they continue as students here at Lyndhurst. 
Finally we will fully launch as a school offering our students the best in STEM focused education. We will continue to offer extra-curricular clubs such as Maryland Science Olympiad, Vex IQ Robotics, and Jr. Lego League but we will be adding new opportunities during the school day for our students to engage in coding, as well a the use of Spheros, and Drones. Students will continue to engage in high-quality, standards-based instruction in the core content areas, as well as receiving instruction in the areas of visual arts, physical education, and technology.  
We invite you to stay connected and actively participate as we move through this exciting time for our school and the community. We are confident that as a Lyndhurst family we will continue to take great strides in excellence.
