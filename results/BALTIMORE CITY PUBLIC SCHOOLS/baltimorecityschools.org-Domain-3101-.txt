Welcome
Welcome to Medfield Heights Elementary School!
A Message from the Principal
On behalf of our school community I would like to welcome you to our school! We are a Pre-K through 5
th
 grade elementary school located in Northwest Baltimore, Maryland. We are most proud of our diverse student population, including students from 18 different countries. Our students are happy to come to school every day and participate in our regular programming as well as our vast amount of after-school clubs. We take great pride in the amount of parent and community support we receive. Through these partnerships, we are able to offer enrichment activities, such as a Robotics Team, Chess Club, a growing instrumental music program, Choir, STEM week, Art Club, and three field trips per year, per grade and much more. Our teachers and staff are exceptionally dedicated to developing our students into responsible, respectful and resourceful community members. We believe in student, parent and teacher voice and make decisions based on input from our stakeholders. We are truly invested in the school community. Collaboratively we continue to reflect and evolve to meet the needs of all of our students in order to challenge all learners equitably and effectively.
