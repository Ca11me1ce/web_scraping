			Maryland Developmental Disabilities Council Application and Survey 		
The Developmental Disabilities Administration (DDA) is developing a new Family Support program which will provide individual and family support for people with developmental disabilities ages 21 and under. The plan is to offer an array of services and supports to meet families' individualized needs. The cap will likely be $12,000 per family/per year. Governor Hogan included $2.4 million (state & federal funds) in the FY2018 budget for this new waiting list initiative. DDA hopes to start offering support in January 2018.
This link will bring you to:
* Eligibility information
* DDA Application
* Survey about the types of supports that families believe should be covered.  
Please provide your input on this important topic. 
DEADLINE - MAY 9, 2017

Reminder About Inclement Weather

How to Find Out If Schools and Offices Are Closed
All full-day closings and delays will be announced as close to 5 a.m. as possible. For early dismissals, announcements are made as soon as the decision is made. On school days with inclement weather, it is also important to be aware of any potential early dismissals.

school websites
