<![CDATA[
February 2018Dear Newcastle Staff, Parents, and Community Members:Each year, we as a Board take a moment to reflect on the many opportunities we have had at Newcastle Elementary School District, and to thank you for allowing us to serve the community in this role.  The 17-18 school year welcomed many new additions to our District and our school.  Adding to our student service team are our new Principal, Director of Technology, and Coordinator of Curriculum and Instruction/Site Supports.   Some of the more visible additions of Phase 1 modernization projects at Newcastle Elementary and Charter School are our new field, parking lot, bus loop area, landscape and connecting stairs and ramp.  Additionally, our 7th and 8th-grade students are in new classrooms with interactive technology and extended &ldquo;learning caf&eacute;&rdquo; space.  6th - 8th-grade students are have transitioned to Chromebooks with keyboards.  This past fall also brought our solar panels online and are generating energy for the school.We are currently planning and preparing for Phase 2 of our modernization.  This next summer will take us into the classrooms and refresh the learning spaces of our Kindergarten through 6th-grade students. When students return in the fall of 2018, they will find new paint, cabinetry, carpet, furniture, technology and more.In keeping with tradition while we transition, we continue to provide a free afternoon bus, stellar Music, Spanish, and P.E. programs, our Positive Behavior Intervention &amp; Support (PBIS), our Student Intervention Team (SIT), and our STEM and homework programs. These are just a few of  the opportunities created to improve outcomes for students!  A continuing source of pride is that once again, we remain among the top scoring districts in the County on State assessments.These accomplishments do not happen in isolation but are a result of the continued collaborative effort from every corner of our District. This level of success comes from the hard work of families and staff working together in support of students; this partnership is the true core of our extraordinary schools.  We are deeply grateful to our staff, our parents and our administrators for their professional and tireless efforts in helping our students reach their full potential.We invite you to participate in our monthly Board meetings, held on the 2nd Wednesday of each month at the Newcastle School District Office. Agendas and information are available on our website: www.newcastle.k12.ca.us. We encourage your involvement and welcome your input as we look forward to another great year for Newcastle Elementary School District in 2018. Thank you for your willingness to support our students and the wonderful opportunities coming our way.Sincerely,Sarah Gillmore, PresidentOn behalf of the Newcastle Elementary School District Board of Trustees
