A note from the nurse:
Hello Newcastle School District Families,
My name is Jennifer Muller and I am so pleased to be the new school nurse for Newcastle School District.  I have been a parent in this district for the past two years and I cannot imagine a better group of educators, parents and students.  I am looking forward to meeting everyone so please feel free to introduce yourself if you see me on campus!
I would also like to make everyone aware of a few items that may be coming home shortly.
I am in the process of reviewing immunization records.  If your student is missing one or more of the required immunizations and does not have a medical or personal beliefs exemption on file, you will be receiving a letter home along with a list of the state required immunizations.  We absolutely need this information back as soon as possible.
If your student has medications at school, we will need a current medical authorization along with the medications.  Please look for this information to come your way if this pertains to your student.  Please keep in mind that if your student needs medication at school for any length of time, we will need a medical authorization on file.  These forms can be found in the office.
If your student has a chronic medical condition or a health concern and we have not spoken yet, please email me at 
jmuller@newcastle.k12.ca.us
 so that we can set up a time to discuss your student’s needs.
My goal is to team with you to ensure your student’s health and safety while they are at school.  Please do not hesitate to contact me if I can be of any assistance.  Here’s to a great school year!
Respectfully,
Jennifer Muller, RN, PHN
School Nurse
