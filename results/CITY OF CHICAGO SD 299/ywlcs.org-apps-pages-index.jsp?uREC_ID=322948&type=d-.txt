												Activities & Clubs									
YWLCS believes in the importance of a "whole girl" education, which encompasses academic achievement, career and college preparation, leadership, and personal and social development. In order to build their self-confidence, explore their interests, and grow both personally and socially, many students elect to participate in a variety of after-school activities and clubs.
