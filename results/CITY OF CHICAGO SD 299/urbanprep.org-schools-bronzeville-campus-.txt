The Bronzeville Campus, our newest campus, is located in the heart of Chicago's Douglas & Grand Boulevard communities, once called the "Black Metropolis" for its extensive historical value to African-American art and culture.  Bronzeville attracts residents, both young and old, with its boldly revitalized brownstones and its close proximity to Loop, Lakefront and South Side attractions.  As this community continues to revitalize itself, Urban Prep young men will be at the forefront, serving as community change agents.
