Academic Support
Faculty and administration continuously monitor students’ progress and provide timely support and assistance.
Academic supports include:
Academic Workshops - Held Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday from 3:15-4:15pm, students work with peers, teachers, and volunteer tutors to increase their academic performance.
Health Services
YWLCS operates a school-based health clinic in partnership with the University of Illinois at Chicago Neighborhoods Initiative Division of Community Health. In 2005, YWLCS received funding from the McKesson Foundation and Grant Healthcare Foundation to renovate and expand the clinic. Today, clinic services are provided by a full-time family nurse practitioner and nurse's assistant, a part-time dietician and a part-time clinical psychologist, supervised by a Board-certified pediatrician.
Along with the health clinic, YWLCS has one full-time Social Worker.
