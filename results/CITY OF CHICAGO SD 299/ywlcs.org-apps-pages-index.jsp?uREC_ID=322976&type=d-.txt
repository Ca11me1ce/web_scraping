																						Why Support YWLCS?																			
Donate Online
Our school depends on private donations to ensure we can continue to provide a robust, STEM college preparatory education to Chicago girls. 
Your donation go towards:
Enhancing our STEM curriculum materials
Upgrading our technology
Providing more hands-on learning programs
Building and Infrastructure Improvements - Our building is 100 years old, often freezing in the winter and sweltering in the summer - a less than favorable learning environment.
Programs and Curriculum Upgrades - We continue to align our curriculum and experiences with educational and career opportunities.
Activities and Clubs:  We remain strong in our commitment to educating the whole girl.
Donate to YWLCS today, every little bit helps!
