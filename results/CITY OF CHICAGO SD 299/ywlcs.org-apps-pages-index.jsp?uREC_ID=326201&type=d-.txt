												Principal's Message									
Greetings YWLCS Families,
I'd like to welcome parents and students to the 2017-18 school year.   At YWLCS, we are committed to educating the whole girl based upon our 4 pillars:  
academic achievement 
leadership
career & college prep
personal & social development
We are a STEM school that also offers a fine arts program.  We have a 92.4% attendance rate and 87.2 freshman-on-track rate to graduate.  Our CPS School Quality Rating is 2+ but with each academic year we continue we to get closer to our level 1 goal which is why I'm pleased to announce several new additions to our academic program:
a new course, the Principles of Biomedical Science 
a few of our girls will compete in a robotics competition in the spring of 2018  
a spring production created by our drama class
YWLCS leadership, faculty and staff are committed to enriching the life of your daughter through our
 LEADERS princip
les.
I have an open door policy so please feel free to email me at vscottthompson@ywlcs.org​​​​​​​.  I look forward to continuing to educate the Girls of Today, Leaders of Tomorrow.
Respectfully,
Dr.  Vanesa Scott-Thompson
Principal, YWLCS
