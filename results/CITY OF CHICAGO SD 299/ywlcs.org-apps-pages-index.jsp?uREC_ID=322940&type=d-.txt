												Our History 									
														Recognizing the under representation of women in science, math and technology, the Young Women's Leadership Charter School (YWLCS) was conceived through the vision and support of twenty-three businesswomen, civic leaders, and philanthropists who were determined to create a school that offered girls in Chicago a rigorous STEM-focused college preparatory education.
On December 15, 1999 the Chicago Board of Education awarded the charter, an on August 22, 2000, YWLCS opened with 75 sixth graders and 75 ninth graders in the basement of Illinois Institute of Technology.
In 2004, YWLCS moved to its current location at 2641 S. Calumet Ave. and graduated it first class of students.  Today, YWLCS serves nearly 350 students from grades 9-12 under the leadership of our Principal, Dr. Vanesa Scott-Thompson and many of the founder continue to volunteer their times as YWLCS Board Members.
