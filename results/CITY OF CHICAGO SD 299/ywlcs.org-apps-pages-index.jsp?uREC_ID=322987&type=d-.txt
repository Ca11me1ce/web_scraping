As the only all-girls public school in Chicago, the Young Women’s Leadership Charter School (YWLCS) engages nearly 350 students in rigorous college preparatory learning with a focus on math, science, and technology - subjects where women, especially women of color, are seriously underrepresented. YWLCS is located in Chicago’s Bronzeville area, there is no cost to attend and admission is determined by a non-selective lottery open to high school age girls in Chicago.
We are pleased to share that the 2016-2017 Academic Year marked the fifth consecutive year that YWLCS achieved a 100% high school graduation and college acceptance rate!
