Title I Funding
As a school who receives federal Title I Funds, we present you with the following policies on an annual basis.  We welcome any questions and offer you more in depth information at our annual Title I information meeting (September 29, 2016).  As parents, you are our partners in your child's education and we encourage you to be informed and work closely with us to enhance your child's experience.  Please contact our Community Coordinator to get involved with our Parent Core Organization (PCO).  Together we are stronger!
