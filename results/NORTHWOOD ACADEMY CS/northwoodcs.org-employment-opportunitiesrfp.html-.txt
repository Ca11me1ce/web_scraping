Northwood is in need of substitute teachers. Viable candidates must be college graduates who have had some experience in a child-related field. If the person is a certified teacher, that's even better! The rate is $125 per day for certified teachers and $100 per day for college graduates. If you know of someone who would like to work with our children, please ask them to notify Mrs. Friedman at pfriedman@northwoodcs.org.
