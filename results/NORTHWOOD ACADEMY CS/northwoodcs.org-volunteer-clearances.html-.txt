Volunteer Policy Information
Effective August 2015, any adult who wishes to serve as a volunteer (this includes field trip chaperones) at Northwood will need background checks and a child abuse history clearance.  This is in accordance with new Child Protective Services Laws effective July 1, 2015.  All three of these clearances can be applied for online.  You will be able to print out the PA criminal history and child abuse clearances at home.  While you can pay for the fingerprinting online, there are specific locations where the actual fingerprinting is done.  Please bring the original certifications to our Community Coordinator, Mrs. Amy Kelly, during school hours.
More information about clearances required under the Child Protective Services law can be found at 
www.keepkidssafe.pa.gov
.  All clearance information will be held in confidence and handled directly by our CEO and Community Coordinator.  Please feel free to contact Mrs. Kelly at 
akelly@northwoodcs.org
 with any questions or concerns.  
Which clearances are needed?
Report of criminal history from the Pennsylvania State Police;
Child Abuse History certification from the Department of Human Services; and
