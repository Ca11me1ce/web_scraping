What Is a Charter School?
Charter schools are public schools that parents choose to send their children to in place of their district-assigned school. They operate under an agreement (the “Charter”) between the charter school and the sponsoring local school board (or state board in the case of “Cyber” charter schools).
Charter schools have the flexibility, authority, and responsibility to innovate in exchange for greater accountability for results–student learning. The “charter” establishing each school is a legal agreement detailing the school’s mission, programs, method of assessment, finances, and measures of success.  
Like other public schools, charter schools are governed by academic standards and students are required to take state standardized tests to help assess the students’ progress and be measured by No Child Left Behind legislation.
Charter schools may not discriminate in admission and all students are selected by lottery.

Who can attend Northwood Academy?
The lottery process is open to all Pennsylvania students in grades K-8, with priority given to students who reside in Philadelphia.  Like other public schools, we are nonsectarian and nondiscriminatory in our admissions policies.
We can enroll up to 788 students under our current charter agreement.  Our student body is ethnically, religiously and culturally diverse.
Students who have submitted Intent to Enroll documentation, are entered into a lottery in March of the previous year they wish to attend.  Siblings are given preference when slots are available.  We also extend lottery preference to incoming kindergartners who reside in the attendance zone which includes Laura Carnell and H.R. Edmunds.   
How do you apply for the enrollment lottery?
Intent to Enroll Applications (lottery applications) and application procedures are available during school hours at our Main Office (4621 Castor Avenue) or on our website from mid- October through Mid- February.

Northwood Academy Charter School Child Find Policy (Annual Notice)
Policy and Procedures for Students with Disabilities 
Northwood Academy Charter School will ensure that all students with disabilities who are eligible to enroll in the school will have available to them free and appropriate public education in the least restrictive environment. The rights of children with disabilities, and those of their parents, will be protected in accordance with federal laws.
As part of this child find responsibility, Northwood seeks to ensure that all students with disabilities who are eligible to enroll in the school are identified, located and evaluated. This child find responsibility shall be accomplished through a process which, while not a definitive or final judgment of a student's capabilities or disability, is a possible indicator of special education needs. 
The child find process shall include obtaining data on each student, through direct assessment of, or by indirect means of,  the student's academic performance, gross and fine motor skills, receptive and expressive language skills, vision, hearing and cognitive skills. 
School staff, parents or agency representatives may refer students to the multi-disciplinary team if they believe that the student, because of a disability, may be in need of special education and supportive services in order to benefit from regular education. Northwood shall ensure that an appropriately certified school psychologist participates in the initial evaluation and all subsequent re-evaluations of the student.
Final identification of students with disabilities and programming for such students occurs only after an appropriate evaluation and a determination by the multi-disciplinary team. If it is determined that the child requires special education and supportive services in order to benefit from regular education, an Individual Education Plan shall be developed for the student in accordance with federal law. 
If you know someone or have a child with a disability who may be in need of special education and related services, you can initiate a referral through the school by contacting Pamela Friedman, Director of Special Education at 215-289-5606  or by emailing to 
pfriedman@northwoodcs.org
