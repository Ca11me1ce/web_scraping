Our kindergarteners took a field lesson to the Consumnes River Preserve to expand on their science unit. What an amazing day of exploration for our kindergarten biologists. #joyfullearners
Our WAVE parent volunteers did an incredible job at our 13th annual International Festival. The cultural booths and food were incredible. The performances, raffle baskets, and dessert walk were a hit. THANK YOU to so many parents who volunteered and donated to make this event a success. 
Thank you to each an every family for visiting our Spring Book Fair. Proceeds from the book fair go directly back to the school. Thank you for getting our students excited about reading, and for supporting our school!
