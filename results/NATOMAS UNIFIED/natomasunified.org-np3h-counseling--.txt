Counseling
Our Counselors are assigned by grade level to individual Advisory classes.  They meet with each student during the school year, to discuss their academic progress, future plans, and address any personal concerns.  Students may request an appointment by sending and email (see below), or by leaving a “Request for a Counseling Appointment” form in their counselor’s mailbox.  Parents and teachers may also refer a student to counseling.
Counselors also:
 Visit Advisory classes to explain the role of counseling
 Work with Advisory Teachers to help each student develop their 4-year plan,
 Provide test prep materials and appropriate career and college prep information to students and parents
 Help coordinate college visits, and present the Academic Planning meetings for parents each February
