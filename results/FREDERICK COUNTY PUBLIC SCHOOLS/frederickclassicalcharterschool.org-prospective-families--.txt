Prospective Families
Registration for the 2018-2019 enrollment lottery is now closed. The lottery drawing for the 2018-2019 School Year will take place on Wednesday, March 28th at 6:30 p.m. 
General Information
Frederick Classical Charter School (FCCS) welcomes elementary and middle school students from Frederick County, Maryland to our public charter school.  Please browse this website for information about classical education and how our Maryland charter school is unique.  Our curriculum is very different from other local schools and follows classical education methods and a research-based approach to educate children of all abilities. Our small school size allows for a close-knit school community.  If you are looking for a public school that provides something special, please consider FCCS.
FCCS enrolls students in Kindergarten through 8th grade.  There are currently 40 students per grade, with two classrooms per grade.  Beginning in Fall 2017, FCCS will phase-in a small increase in class size to 42 students per grade in grades 1-8.
School Interest & Information Nights
Throughout the school year, Frederick Classical Charter School holds meetings for potential students and parents to introduce them to the classical model of instruction and explain the Frederick Classical enrollment process.  Meetings begin at 7:00 pm in the school cafeteria.
Information Nights for the 2017-18 Academic Year are complete.
Orientation Night for newly admitted and accepted families will be held April 17.
Please note, weather related cancellations will not be rescheduled.
If you are unable to make one of these events, the Admissions Committee is happy to answer your questions by email: 
admissions@frederickclassicalcharterschool.org
.
Who can enroll?
Children applying for enrollment in the school must be residents of Frederick County, Maryland by July 1st preceding the start of the school year and must follow FCPS registration eligibility guidelines.  New residents or others who wish to be added to the waitlist during the school year will need to provide proof of residency once the child is admitted.
How Do I Enroll My Child?
Admission to the Frederick Classical Charter School is determined by lottery held in the Spring and a waitlist managed year-round.  There is no opportunity to enroll in the school outside of the lottery process.  
Current students will automatically be enrolled for the next school year. The annual lottery fills any vacant seats and establishes the order of the waiting list. FCCS Founding Family members, children of FCCS faculty or staff, and siblings of children currently enrolled at FCCS have priority for placement in available spots, but must still register for the lottery. Additional names can be added to the waitlist outside of the lottery registration period.  Frederick County Public Schools central office provides oversight to the lottery process.  Every effort will be made to notify prospective families of lottery results or waitlist openings in a timely manner.
Enrollment Lottery
Registration for the lottery for the 2018-2019 school year is now open.  The registration period closes on Monday, March 12, 2018. The lottery drawing will be held on Wednesday, March 21, 2018 (Snow Date: March 28).
The annual enrollment lottery for the 2017-2018 school year took place on March 15, 2017. Registered families have been provided a confirmation of lottery results. 
For entry during this academic year, please register for the waitlist (details below).
Register for the Waitlist
If it is outside of the lottery registration window, you may add your child to the waitlist for the current school year.  The online waitlist registration page for 2017-2018 is 
here
. If your child is on the waitlist for the current school year, you must register again for the lottery for the following school year (waitlist names do not carry over from one year to the next). The waitlist for the next school year (Academic Year 2018-2019) will become available April 2018. If your child is already on the wait list and you have a question, please send an email to erica.cummins@fcps.org.
Siblings of Current Students – Lottery registration is necessary for new enrollment of siblings of currently-enrolled students, founding family members, and children of faculty or staff.  These families must enter the current student's name in the field provided when completing the lottery registration form.  No lottery application is necessary for a currently enrolled student who wishes to remain at the school. 
Confirmation – You will receive an email confirmation once you complete the online registration.  Any changes you need to submit to your application should be emailed to 
admissions@frederickclassicalcharterschool.org
.  Applications for admission or changes to existing applications received outside of the lottery registration period are not eligible to participate in the lottery and will be placed at the bottom of the waiting list.
Enrollment forms and other registration requirements will be provided once your child has been offered a spot at the school. If your child is selected for admission, you will need to accept the desired placement (instructions are mailed) in the time specified.
FCCS will use the contact information provided on the Enrollment Application for correspondence regarding lottery results and placement.
