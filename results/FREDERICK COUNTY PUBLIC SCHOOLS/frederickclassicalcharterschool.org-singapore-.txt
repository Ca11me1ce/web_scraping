Singapore Math Test Results
These tests cover the material for the level indicated on the tests. Therefore, each test is really an exit test for the level, and can be used to see what types of problems are given in the curriculum. An overall score of 80% and above on a test is a good indicator that the student has the skills to go on to the next level. These tests were given the first year to set the benchmark data for math. 
Singapore Results Summary
1st Grade - 2013/2014
2nd Grade - 2013/2014
3rd Grade - 2013/2014
4th Grade - 2013/2014
5th Grade - 2013/2014
6th Grade - 2013/2014
What is Singapore Math? 
Singapore math, which refers to the teaching methods or the actual curriculum used for kindergarten through sixth grade in the small island country, has become popular due to Singapore’s consistent top ranking on an international assessment of student math achievement called the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS). In the latest TIMSS report in 2007, Singapore was ranked in the top three in fourth- and eighth-grade math scores, while the United States ranked ninth and eleventh, respectively.
Mastery, Not Memorization
Supporters of Singapore math credit the Singaporean methods of instruction and curriculum for its students’ success. While American math instruction often relies on drilling and memorization of many skills each year, Singapore math focuses on children not just learning but also truly mastering a limited number of concepts each school year. The goal is for children to perform well because they understand the material on a deeper level; they are not just learning it for the test.
