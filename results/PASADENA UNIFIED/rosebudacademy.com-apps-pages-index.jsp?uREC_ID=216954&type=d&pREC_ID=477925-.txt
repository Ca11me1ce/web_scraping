PTO Mission Statement
The Pasadena Rosebud PTO is a nonprofit parent teacher organization whose membership includes all parent, legal guardians and staff at Pasadena Rosebud Academy. The PTO's mission is to establish a close relationship between home and school by advancing opportunity for all parents to become involved in the Pasadena Rosebud Academy community. The PTO sponsors assistance to teachers in classroom setting, raises funds for supplemental educational materials and experiences, supports school and family social interaction, and provides a non-biased forum for sharing information on issues that impact our students. It is our belief that the team effort of a parent teacher organization offers the best possible learning environment for our children.
