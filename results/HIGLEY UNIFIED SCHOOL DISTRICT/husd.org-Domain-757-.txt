Thank you
SFE is proud to partner with Higley Unified School District with the mission of enhancing your students' quality of life through fresh and wholesome food, a strong focus on nutrition, and unparalleled customer service. We understand that nutrition has an essential role in your child’s learning each and every day. All campuses offer breakfast and lunch to all students every school day. Based on the belief that a well-nourished student is better prepared to receive the instruction of the school day, the food and nutrition department plays a necessary role in each school’s educational team.
Our Menus
A variety of meals are offered each week that follow appropriate nutrition standards for children and the federal guidelines. We work to keep sodium, fat, and cholesterol low; keeping fiber, vitamins and minerals high, while still offering foods that kids love. Healthy, appealing, and interesting breakfast and lunch choices are prepared on-site at every campus for our students. In addition to various hot menu choices, salad/fruit bars and other food bar choices are available on a daily basis. 
You can find information on menus, meal costs and payment through the links on this page.
National School Lunch Program
The National School Lunch Program is a program sponsored by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Through this program, eligible students may be offered free or reduced-price meals. This program operates in all of the schools in the Higley Unified School District. Application information will remain confidential and will be used only to determine eligibility for free or reduced-priced meals. Applications are available online at mymealtime.com.  We encourage all parents to join us in our effort to save paper.  However, if you are unable to complete an application online, you may pick one up at your child’s school or the district office.  Please be aware that online applications may take up to 3 business days to approve, while paper applications may take 10 business days to approve.
