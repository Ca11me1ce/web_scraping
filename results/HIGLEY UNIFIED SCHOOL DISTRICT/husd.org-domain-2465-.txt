3rd Quarter Sports
If you are planning on trying out for a 3rd quarter sport, please be sure you are registered in Register My Athlete.  All students trying out for a 3rd quarter sport MUST be cleared by Wednesday, December 20th.
If you have tried out for OR played a 1st or 2nd quarter sport, and plan on trying out for a 3rd quarter sport, please be sure and log into your Register My Athlete account and register for the 3rd quarter sport.  If you need directions on how to do this, please stop by the front office.  You MUST be cleared for the 3rd quarter in order to try out.  Thank you.
Athletic Clearance Process 
In an attempt to streamline the athletic clearance process, Cooley Middle School has gone paperless.  You will now complete the athletic clearance packet electronically at 
registermyathlete.com
. 
All forms can be viewed and signed electronically.  All additional required forms must be uploaded to your account (i.e. physical forms and concussion test results). 
Please follow the instruction link below to register your student for athletic clearance for the 2017-2018 school year.
Please note that physicals must be dated after March 1, 2017 to be used for the 2017-2018 school year.
It is strongly recommended that all documents be submitted electronically prior to the break that precedes your student's sport season.  Incomplete registrations will prohibit your student from participating in try-outs.
