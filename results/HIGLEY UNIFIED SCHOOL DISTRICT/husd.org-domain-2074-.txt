Ceramics and Drawing Calendar
Dear Parents,
I wanted to welcome you and your student to the Ceramics and Drawing and Painting classes. A little about myself, I am not an Arizona native; I grew up in a small town in Connecticut. I received my Bachelors of Science degree in Art Education from Southern Connecticut University.  I have lived in Arizona for about fifteen years and have taught for thirteen years (eleven of those years here in the Higley district). I returned to school, getting my Masters in Educational Leadership from Northern Arizona University in 2010. I love the weather here and I enjoy the warmer winters.
I care about my students as if they were my own. It is very important to me to make sure that my classroom is a safe and positive environment. I feel that it is important that every student have a positive experience in class.
In Ceramics class we will be learning about the three pottery hand building techniques: pinch method, coil method and slab method, and also learn how to use the potter’s wheel. The class will cover the different cultures where pottery is used and the artists in the field of ceramic arts.  Students will participate in self and class critiques on their artwork assignments that will help them improve their future artistic work.
In Drawing and Painting class we will learn about different drawing and painting techniques and their applications. Throughout the class we will also cover the different types of artistic mediums and the distinguished artists throughout the years. Students will also participate in self and class critiques on their artwork assignments that will help them improve their future artistic work. All class curriculum,projects, and assignments are in line with the state standards requirements.
