Hello! After spending a decade teaching in the Mesa district, I am now returning for my eighth year in the Higley district.  Over the years I have taught Freshman AP (honors) English, 8th grade English and Accelerated English, and both standard and honors 8th grade American Studies.  I was also the freshman baseball coach at my former school for seven years, and I am proud to say that I coached the 8th grade boys to a baseball title at Chaparral.  I look forward to another terrific year, and I am excited to be a part of the  Cooley team.  
Go Cougars! 
4/20
Parents:
  While I am a strong proponent of advocating for improved educational financing in Arizona, I wish to convey that I voted NOT to participate in a state-wide teacher walk out.  I was hopeful that other avenues could have been further explored in the way of finding a satisfactory resolution without potentially disrupting the educational process.  
4/2
Parents,
  You will see a change in the 4th quarter grading format for your child.  The first two weeks are being spent reviewing for the AzMerit test on April 9-11, so most of the grades during that time will simply be completion/participation scores.  Once AzMerit is completed, however, your child will be starting a rigorous research project that will take several weeks to complete (more information will be provided after AzMerit).  This project will mean fewer grades in the gradebook, since each component takes several days to complete; since the project is a form of assessment, however, each section will constitute a more significant portion of the overall grade.  Since your child is learning 9th grade standards this semester, I will be accepting late work for the project in a manner more closely resembling that of a high school class: students will lose a full letter grade for each day late (not counting excused absences), resulting in a zero score after the fourth day.  Each section of the project is completed independent of the others, leading up to submission of the entire project on the final due date.  It is important that your child puts forth his/her best effort to ensure success in this endeavor.  
2/4
Dear parent/guardian,
Cooley parent-teacher conferences will be taking place on Wednesday, February 14th from 5:00-7:00 p.m. and Thursday, February 15th from 2:00-4:00 p.m. and 5:00-7:00 p.m.  If you would like the opportunity to sit down and discuss your child’s progress in Language Arts but have not receive a sign up invitation, please type the link below to access the sign-up site. 
Sincerely,
J. McNavish
1/24
Parents: 
Second semester parent-teacher conferences will take place on 2/14 and 2/15.  A sign up link will be provided in this location next week.
12/17
Parents/students:
If a student misses midterm examinations this week, he/she will be given a zero on the exam per administration.  The student will make up the exam during the first week back after Winter Break, and a grade change form will be submitted at that time.  
10/17
Parents/students:
The first major essay of the year will be due on Monday, October 23rd; all instructions for writing the essay can be found on the practice link of my teacher page.  Final drafts must be submitted in ink--they may either be typed or written in blue/black pen.
9/14
Parents/students:
With the end of the first quarter only two weeks away, it is important that you check your grades on a regular basis; since this is an accelerated class, the expectation is for every student to maintain no lower than a C throughout the year.  The level of rigor increases every quarter, so it is highly recommended that you complete every assignment and take advantage of assessment retake opportunities when proficiency has not been demonstrated.  
8/14
Parents:
Parent-teacher conferences will be held on Wednesday, 8/30 from 5:00-7:00 and Thursday the 31st from 2:00-4:00 and 5:00-7:00.  I will be sending out conference intivations later this week for students who may be struggling; if you would like to schedule a conference but have not received an invitation by this Friday, please type the link below and follow the instructions to schedule a conference.
7/26
Parents:
Curriculum Night will take place on August 1st from 5:30-7:00 in the evening; your child will be providing you with a map and copy of his/her schedule on the 1st.
 7/20
Parents:
If you would like to sign up for Constant Contact in order to receive emails about school-wide news, emergency information, and upcoming events, visit www.husd.org/emailcom and enter your information.
 7/19
Parents:
HUSD recently adopted a new Language Arts textbook for use throughout the district; as a result, many aspects of the former curriculum have been significantly altered.  If you would like to learn more about some of the changes to the ELA curriculum, I would strongly suggest attending the upcoming Curriculum Night on August 1st (if possible).  Specific information about the event will be posted to this page in the next week or so.   
Recommended supplies:
 5 subject college-ruled spiral notebook (highly recommended)
highlighter(s)
blue or black pen and a red pen for editing
package of 3x5 lined notecards
#2 pencils
dry erase marker(s)
loose-leaf paper
 * please note that I have almost all of these materials, such as pencils and paper, available in the classroom.  The spiral notebook is the only item that I do not have available.
