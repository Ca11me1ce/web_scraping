Announcements
May 3, 2018
Dear Higley Families:
We are happy to announce that schools will reopen on Friday, May 4, and will resume a normal schedule, including before and after-school Kids Club care.
Regarding make-up days: Arizona schools are required to meet a prescribed number of instructional minutes per the state statute. Higley will meet the required number of minutes without extending the current school calendar, which ends May 23. There will be no additional schools days for students.
As a reminder, AP testing and graduation ceremonies will continue as scheduled for high schools.
For any concerns or questions, please contact your school principal.
We look forward to seeing students and employees back to school to finish out the 2017-18 school year strong.
Sincerely,
Dr. Mike Thomason
Superintendent

E-mail communication
Higley Unified School District has launched an APP as another tool for communication with Higley families. The new system will allow schools to send e-mails, as well as push notifications for those who download the app. 
We are excited to offer this new communication tool to our families and look forward to seeing how it grows over the next few months.
Please note: In order to continue receiving e-mail communication, families must have a current, up-to-date e-mail address on file with their schools. The current Constant Contact system will be phased out before the end of the school year. Families that do not have an updated e-mail with the schools may not receive all the communication being sent.
If you have changed your e-mail in the last few months, created a new e-mail or have not provided an e-mail to your school, please do so as quickly as possible.

Bridges named AZ STEM School of Community Practice
Higley Unified School District’s newest elementary school has been named an AZ STEM School Community of Practice.
Bridges Elementary School joins 56 schools from across the state to collaborate with Maricopa Education Service Agency, Arizona  SciTech, Intel and the Arizona Science Center.
“This is an amazing opportunity for our school community to learn from other innovative schools within the state. Many collaborative opportunities are planned throughout this next school year that will certainly put us on the road to excellence in terms of STEM,” Bridges Principal Sherry Richards said.
STEM stands for Science, Technology, Engineering and Math.
