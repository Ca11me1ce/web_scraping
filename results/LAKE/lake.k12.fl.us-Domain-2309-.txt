Incoming 6th Grade Parent Night
Mark your calendar! 
GMS will be hosting an incoming parent night on Thursday, April 19, 2018, from 6-8pm in the auditorium. Teachers and administrators will present information on policies and procedures, academics, extracurricular, technology and much more.  This year we will offer a student panel discussion for the incoming gators.
Our Mission
Our mission is to provide a safe, supportive learning environment with opportunities for all students to develop the skills and knowledge to become a responsible citizen in a global society.
The “TEAM” Concept
 Cecil E. Gray Middle School (GMS) is organized into teams. Students at each grade level are assigned to a team and usually are taught by the same team of teachers for core subject areas. The team structure ensures a comfortable, nurturing, and challenging environment for the students. In addition to their six classes, students will take part in Repair and Accelerate (R&A), a 30 minute, five times a week program. This time was developed to help students with organizational and progress monitoring strategies, a weekly topic, and tutoring (repair) or acceleration (project). The student is the most important member of a team; and the teachers are focused on moving the student from Good to Great! Teachers, counselors and administrators are available to help in any situation.
Schedule
 Check out the schedule below. If you missed the presentation or want to review the material the power point links will be available after April 19.

GATOR CAMP
August 2, 2018
9:00–11:00AM
GATOR CAMP is a program designed to help INCOMING SIXTH GRADERS become familiar with the campus, classrooms, and some of our teachers.
Students will participate in various “classes” and take a tour of the campus. Students will be given information on dress code, agendas, supplies, textbooks, discipline, academics, and enrichment classes. A special treat will be given during the tour.
Students should be on campus no earlier than 8:45-9:00am and picked up promptly at 11:00am on Magnolia Street at the parent pick up/drop off area. We hope to see you all there! For further information, please contact Gray Middle School at (352) 429–3322.
GATOR CAMP is also a program designed to help incoming 6th grade 
parents
 become familiar with our academic focus, the bell schedule and a few helpful hints on being a middle school parent.
Parents will participate in a group meeting in the auditorium from 9:15-10:45am, Parent participation is strongly encouraged but your attendance is not mandatory for your child to attend GATOR CAMP.
If you would like your child to attend,  please click the link below and follow the instructions on the form.
