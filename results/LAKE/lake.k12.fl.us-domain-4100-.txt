Sonier, Catherine
Welcome
Welcome to our new school year. Kindergarten is a fun filled year packed with learning and changes for our students.Kinders go through a magnificent transformation as the school year progresses. 
My promise to your child as their Kindergarten teacher is to always have high expectations for them. I promise to teach and guide them and to always help them in reaching their full potential. I will encourage them and provide a safe environment where they feel comfortable to ask questions or to ask for help if they need to. In my class we are a school family and we help and look out for each other. I promise to teach curriculum that is project based and provides rigor so that all students are learning on their level and can reach their higher goals. Students in my class will learn about setting goals for their learning and I will provide them with the strategies to reach these goals. 
My promise to you as a parent of a Kinder is to always be available to talk or meet with you. No matter how small or big your concern is, I always encourage you to contact me. I am available to meet with you on almost any day. I can meet before school (7:30-8am), during my planning period (8:40-9:20am) or after school (3:30-4pm). You can e-mail me at Sonierc@lake.k12.fl.us or you can call the school and leave a message for me to call you back (352-394-2600). You can send in a note asking for a conference or for a phone call. I promise to always have your child's best interest at heart and your help in communicating anything that you or child feel needs to be addressed, clarified, or brought to my attention will help me in this quest. 
Thank you for your support and for allowing me be your child's Kindergarten teacher, we are going to have an awesome year!
