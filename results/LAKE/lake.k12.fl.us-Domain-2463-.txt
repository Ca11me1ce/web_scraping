Lake County Schools Suggested Technology List
As the district takes additional steps to integrate technology in and out of the classrooms, we want to provide parents a resource they can use when shopping for new technology for their child. The Holiday season is right around the corner and the district has just published a list of suggested laptops, tablets and other devices for their next shopping trip.  The first page includes specs of the various suggested devices – this list has been filtered through the district IT staff. Many parents may want to purchase something that may not be on our list. If that’s the case, we’ve provided the minimum suggested requirements on the back side. Again, we’re not requiring parents to purchase devices, but if a parent is going to buy new technology for their child, this is a good resource of the technology that we support at Lake County Schools.
