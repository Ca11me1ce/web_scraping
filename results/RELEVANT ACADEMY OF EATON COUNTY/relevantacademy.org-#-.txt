Program Description
RELEVANT ACADEMY is a tuition-free public school academy
 for high school aged students who are ready to start again and redefine themselves.  Our mission is to provide an alternative pathway to earn a high school diploma for students who have struggled to experience success in a traditional setting.
WE BELIEVE that all people are natural learners, redefining school will redefine attitudes, and with enough support, all types of learners can achieve their goals.
