TISA School Schedule Changes
09 Feb 2018
Dear TISA Families,   Today we went before the Public Education Commission to contest the findings of the Charter School Division concerning our hours. The PEC voted that we could amend our charter to properly reflect our correct hours. As a result, we are no longer required to make-up Fridays and no longer have to extend the school day for our lower grades. Therefore, starting Monday, February 12th we will go back to our normal schedule as follows:   Student Pick Up/Drop Off Times: Grade Drop Off Class Start Pick Up Kinder 8:15 8:30 3:30 1st-4th 8:00 8:15 3:40 5th-6th 7:50 […]

Those Fridays will be January 12th and 26th, February 9th […]
