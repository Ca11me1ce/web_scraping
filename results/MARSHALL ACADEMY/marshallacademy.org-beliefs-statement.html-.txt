Marshall Academy Beliefs Statement
Marshall Academy educates children to become successful, productive,  and independent members of a free society. Stressing solid preparation  in the fundamental academic skills of reading and phonics, writing, and  computation, the curriculum incorporates the best of the Western  tradition and modern innovation in a creative, values-centered approach.  Each student receives personalized instruction from teachers dedicated  to the well rounded development of the young. Marshall Academy  emphasizes the dignity and self-respect which results from a child's  academic accomplishment, right behavior, and proper regard for others.  When Academy students come to school, they come to important, rigorous  work in a well-structured and caring environment. Both their conduct and  dress must support the school's seriousness of purpose.
 												Marshall Academy represents a unique partnership among  the students, parents, faculty, administration, and staff. These  partners are united in their commitment to the common objectives  outlined in our mission and standards. As role models and instructors,  Marshall Academy teachers will be valued by students and parents for  their caring attitudes. Intelligence, creative teaching ability,  loyalty, and responsibility are characteristics we require of the  faculty. Parents expect and appreciate direct and regular communication  from faculty regarding their children. Reciprocally, Marshall Academy's  parents should be responsive to teacher suggestions for helping  students. The headmaster, along with the board of directors, verifies  and endorses the Mission Statement and oversees its implementation in  the school. In their capacities as policy makers and community leaders,  these administrators advance the Academy's role as an institution  committed to children. At Marshall Academy we are committed to the  philosophy of educating the individual child by helping each student  acquire knowledge. By providing standards of ethical and moral values by  which one may live, we are preparing students to accept the privileges  and responsibilities of citizenship in a democratic, moral society.  Every child is capable of achieving his or her potential to the fullest  extent when afforded respect, fairness, kindness, loving discipline, and  appropriate instruction.
