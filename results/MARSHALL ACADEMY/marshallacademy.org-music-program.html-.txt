The Marshall Academy Music Program
Marshall Academy believes that music is important to each student and we take full advantage of all the educational benefits of general and formal music instruction. Our elementary students are offered a general music class twice each week with vocal performances at Christmas and in the spring. The students in general music class interact with music by singing, listening, and creating music using a wide variety of percussion instruments. Additionally, the general music students learn improvisation, history, and appreciation. As the musical knowledge of the child increases, so does the sophistication of their compositions. Students creating fine examples of each composition assignment are asked to perform their work at opening ceremony. 
Recorders (3rd Grade)
In the third grade, students begin to learn how to read music notation through the use of the baroque recorder, (the original flute). For each level passed in our method book, the student receives a ribbon or sticker to display on their recorder. They perform on their recorders at both concerts during the school year.
Chorus (Grades 3-7)
The third grade students that love to sing are invited to join the Marshall Academy Chorus. The chorus meets twice a week before school and is open to all third through eighth grade students.  We try to keep the chorus songs fun, but  students will also begin to learn an introduction to sight singing.
Musicals (5th & 6th  Grade)
In the fifth grade, students begin to explore musical theatre. Each year since the founding of Marshall Academy, our students have produced and performed in an original musical play. The musical is usually performed at the Franke Center for the Performing Arts in downtown Marshall. The students have to audition, rehearse, block, memorize lines, create costumes, and choreograph as they would in any professional production. The results are amazing! You will have to attend one of these incredible productions to believe it! Recently, the students have been creating an original cast recording of our musicals and offering the CD for sale as a fundraiser for the music department.
Band
We recognize that instrumental music instruction increases the capacity for learning in other disciplines, so we begin band early at the academy. Students begin band in the fourth grade and meet three times each week during the school day. They are eager to perform their new skills at the Christmas concert. The advancement from the Christmas concert to the Spring concert is very impressive!  
The fifth grade students progress into intermediate band. The students require more proficiency on their chosen instrument and begin to sound more musically mature. We focus more on independent part reading and the students extend their range and musicianship.
Sixth grade band students can become quite advanced. They are focused on mastering their instruments and preparing for admission to the Varsity band in seventh grade. On occasion, hardworking sixth grade students are invited to learn and play with the Varsity band when they demonstrate they are ready.
The Varsity Band at Marshall Academy currently consists of all 7th through 12th grade band students. Our instrumentation is much broader and the students read high school level scores. The concerts or our Varsity Band are very impressive in their scope and sound.  The Varsity Band marches in the Marshall Christmas parade every year.
