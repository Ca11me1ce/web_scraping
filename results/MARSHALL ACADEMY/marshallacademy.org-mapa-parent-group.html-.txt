Marshall Academy Parents' Association
President: Deb Palmer
																Vice President: Karen Figueroa
																Treasurer: Heather Weberling
																Secretary: 
																Newsletter Editor: Cyd Deane
Close ties between home and school are essential to Marshall Academy's  effectiveness. These ties are strengthened through the Parents'  Association, which plans field trips, coordinates library volunteers,  and organizes
 other extracurricular activities. Association members meet monthly and support the Academy's mission. 												
All parents of Marshall Academy students automatically  receive membership in the Marshall Academy Parents Alliance (MAPA),  which exists to promote friendly relationships among parents, to  acquaint them with the spirit of Marshall Academy, to obtain their  cooperation with its objectives for the development of their children,  and to initiate the parents' involvement in, and support for, projects  and functions.
