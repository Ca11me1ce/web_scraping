Music & Band
Hi, my name is 
Kim Federer
 and I am the Music teacher at CCA. I teach elementary music, 5th grade and middle school bands, and middle school choir.  I have taught here since 2013, and really enjoy being able to share my love and knowledge of music with all of the great students here.  My goal is for my students to have a love of music that extends beyond the classroom and into their everyday lives, and for them to participate in music activities they enjoy.
I was born and raised in Laramie, Wyoming, and got my music education degree at the University of Wyoming in 1997.  After college, I taught elementary music, band, and orchestra in Gillette, Wyoming. In 2001 my family relocated to Colorado, and I have lived in Hudson since then.
I have 2 sons, one of whom graduated and moved back to Wyoming, and the other is a student here at CCA. They mean the world to me! Some of my favorite things are coffee, music, and vintage Volkswagons.  When I am not at school, I enjoy cooking, knitting, crochet, sewing, reading, playing video games, teaching private music lessons, and spending time with my family.  I play trumpet in the Thornton Community Band and for the Bugles Across America organization that provides a live bugler for military funerals and services.
