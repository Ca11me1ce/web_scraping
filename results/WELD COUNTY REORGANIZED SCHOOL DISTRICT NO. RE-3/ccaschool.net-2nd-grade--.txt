2nd Grade
Hello, my name is 
Lisa Rupple
 and I am the 2nd grade teacher at CCA.  I grew up in the Prospect Valley area, attended Prospect Valley Elementary, and graduated from Weld Central High School, Northeastern Junior College, and the University of Northern Colorado.
I have been connected to CCA for many years, even before it was a school.  I was part of the group that worked to create our charter, making CCA a reality.  I began working here during our first year and have stayed for 17 years.  My job titles have included librarian, aide, and classroom teacher.  I spent five years as the kindergarten aide before teaching 5th grade for eight years.  This will be my third year teaching 2nd grade.  My husband, Corey, and I have three kids, all of whom attended CCA.  Daughters TaylorAnn and Cassidy stayed through 8th grade and have since moved out on their own.  My son, Tanner, will be a 7th grader this year.  Our granddaughters, Morgan and Maesyn, will start Kindergarten in 2020 and 2022 respectively.  It is safe to say that I am committed to CCA as a teacher and a parent.
When I am not in my classroom, I enjoy reading, cooking, sewing, crafting, and spending time with my family.  We spend a lot of time attending our son’s 4-H and sports events, but also enjoy supporting the Colorado Rockies, Colorado Eagles, and CSU sports teams.  Of course, there’s never enough time to spoil our two granddaughters!
I look forward to another fun and exciting year with my “Seconds”, watching them grow and change, learn new skills, and achieve things they never expected!
