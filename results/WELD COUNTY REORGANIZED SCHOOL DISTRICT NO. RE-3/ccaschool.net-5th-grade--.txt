5th Grade
Hello, my name is 
Lisa Cole
 and I am the 5th grade teacher at CCA!
Thanks to the late, great Walt Disney, my students know “All our dreams can come true if we have the courage to pursue them.” My dream has been to teach for as long as I can remember. After nearly twenty years of following my dream, I still love what I do. I began my career as a teacher in a maximum security juvenile detention center where I spent three years teaching and learning with students with various backgrounds. Since then, I have taught third and fifth grades at CCA. 
Adventures with my own family just help to add to what I can share with my students. My husband is a veteran, and my two teenagers keep me on the go with football, volleyball, and track. With school and family, there isn’t a lot of time left for other hobbies, but I wouldn’t change that for the world. Teamwork, family, and support are three pillars of success at home and in my fifth grade classroom.
