Kindergarten
Hello, my name is 
Stacy Diller
 and I’m the Kindergarten teacher at CCA!
I’m a native of this community, having attended Keenesburg Elementary, Prospect Valley Elementary, and Weld Central Jr/Sr High School.  I went on to the University of Northern Colorado in Greeley where I graduated with a major in English and an emphasis in Elementary Education.  Since then, I’ve taught 5th grade, music, 2nd grade, and of course, Kindergarten.  The 2017-2018 school year marks my 20th year as an educator; 15 of those years have been at CCA.
My oldest son, Jacob, is a senior at Weld Central this year and my youngest, Harley, is a freshman there.  My step-son, Wyatt, is stationed in Connecticut with the Navy, where he lives with his wife and son.  My step-daughter, Kodi, is currently attending Metro State University where she is studying to be an elementary teacher.  Besides spending time with our family, my husband, Chris, and I enjoy camping, boating, cooking, and spending time on the porch.  I also keep busy as the bookkeeper for my family’s crop-dusting business, Air Dusters, and I spend as much time as I can with my favorite pastime, reading.
I love CCA for many reasons.  It’s given my own sons a quality education through small class sizes and caring, dedicated teachers.  It’s a place I love coming each day to see so many happy faces–my fellow teachers, our amazing aides, and of course the students & their families.
As a Kindergarten teacher, I get to witness the growth children make socially and academically.  Guiding children to learn to read and write is the best and I feel blessed to be able to do that daily!  The word “Kindergarten” comes from the German language, meaning “a garden for children.”  I love to think of our classroom as a garden where we work and toil to foster a place for amazing growth.  Stop by and see us anytime–we can always use an extra pair of hands!
