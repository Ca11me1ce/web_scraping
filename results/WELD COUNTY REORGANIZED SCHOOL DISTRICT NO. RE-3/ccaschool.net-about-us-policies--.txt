Letter from the Director
Welcome to the Cardinal Community Academy School. This handbook has been compiled to provide you with information regarding your child’s educational experience at CCA. It is hoped that you will read this handbook and review it with your child. It is important that your child know that you support the educational programs and rules that govern the school. Certainly this handbook is not all encompassing, and there may well be times you have questions that the handbook does not answer. Please know that you may call us (303-732-9312) any time you have questions or concerns. We will be happy to assist you in any way we can.
Educating your child is an awesome job that requires the cooperation and teamwork of home and school. We need you to be involved in the education of your child, and we also need your volunteer efforts to help the school run efficiently and smoothly. Without your involvement, your child and the school will be missing a critical link. Please join with us in providing a quality education for your child. – April Dowdy, Director
