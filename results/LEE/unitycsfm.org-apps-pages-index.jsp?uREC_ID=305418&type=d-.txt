												PTA									
As parents or guardians, you are your child’s first teacher and we welcome you as partners in the education of your child. Please assist us to encourage good attendance and study skills. We look forward to having you join our Parent Teacher Association (P.T.A.) and help us create a positive relationship between home and school where we stand united for the benefit of our children. I believe that by working together, we can make a difference in the education of our students.
