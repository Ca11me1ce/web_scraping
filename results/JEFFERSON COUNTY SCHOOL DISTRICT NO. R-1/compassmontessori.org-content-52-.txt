Tours and Parent Orientation    
New Parent Orientation for Lottery 
Mandatory meeting for all potential parents held at our Wheat Ridge campus. Pre-registration is not required. Meetings will begin promptly at 
6:00 pm
 and are located at 
10399 W 44th Avenue, Wheat Ridge, CO 80033
. If you are more than 10 minutes late we ask that you attend another New Parent Orientation for Lottery meeting. We cover a good deal of information in this meeting and it is important you hear the entire presentation.
If you missed the First Round Lottery and a Parent Orientation Meeting, we will still accept your Second Round Application and if your child is offered a spot at Compass Montessori School we require a one-on-one informational meeting with you before you accept your position.
