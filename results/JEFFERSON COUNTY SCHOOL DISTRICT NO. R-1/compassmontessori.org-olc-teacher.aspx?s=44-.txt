My name is Samantha.  I grew up in Cincinnati, Ohio and visited my first Montessori classroom at the age of 5 where my aunt was the teacher.  I can still remember getting a lesson on Pin Punching and wishing I could stay in that classroom forever.  Now, many years later, I have been teaching in a Montessori classroom since receiving my M.Ed in Montessori in 1995 from Xavier University.  With a future certain to include a beach residence, or so I thought, I accepted a job at a Montessori school on the island of Tortola in the British Virgin Islands immediately upon graduating, and took a much needed respite.  With so many reservations about the wilderness, I reluctantly let my cousin talk me into accompanying her in her travels to complete the hours she needed to finish her Backcountry Rescue requirements.  The trip that followed changed the course of my life.  I moved to Colorado at the end of a two and a half month backcountry camping trip through Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming.  That said, Colorado is where my Montessori teaching career began in the fall of 1995.  Then just 11 years into my teaching career, with a little help from my husband, we had a daughter.  Waiting the 3 years for her to turn 3 and to begin in Children's House classroom seemed like forever!  Sharing the Montessori system of education and the philosophy with her gave me the opportunity to experience Montessori through an entirely new lens, both as a teacher and then as a parent.  Currently, with two daughters, ages 8 and 10, flourishing in Montessori, I feel extremely fortunate that my life, my career, and my passions intersected so gracefully and continue to surprise and inspire me each and every day.  
This is my 9th year at Compass and I can't say enough about my wonderful team!  Together for the last 4 years, with Ms. Lesa and Ms. Eva happily by my side, the Mountain Room has a wealth of life experiences, knowledge, passion and dedication waiting to greet the children each day!
