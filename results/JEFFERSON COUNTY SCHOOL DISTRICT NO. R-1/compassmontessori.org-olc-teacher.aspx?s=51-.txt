Welcome to the Earth Room! 
We are an Upper Elementary classroom at Compass Montessori in Wheat Ridge, Colorado. We believe that it is essential that the children are in a student-centered learning environment where they are encouraged to learn through discovery and hands-on manipulation of materials. We believe that students need to be active in their learning process, and therefore students will be encouraged to question and actively involve themselves in our lessons and the learning that occurs throughout their journey with us. We also value the interweaving of all content areas, highlighting the interconnectedness of academic disciplines. Students are also encouraged to teach and assist their peers as this helps to meet their desire to socialize and understanding the world around them.
We will foster students in our classroom who have the necessary skills to communicate and explore their community, become independent individuals as they build interpersonal skills, and find information to further their learning beyond the classroom.
We are so excited to have your children in our classroom and we look forward to seeing them blossom as individuals in our three years together!
