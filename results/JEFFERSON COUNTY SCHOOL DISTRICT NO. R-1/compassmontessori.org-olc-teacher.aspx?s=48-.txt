Welcome! We are Megan Witucki and Erin Oliver and we are the co-teaching team in the Aspen Room. This is our fourth year as a teaching team here at Compass and we are thrilled to be here! We were both drawn to the Montessori method and believe in its magic with all types of learners. We both enjoy the challenges and daily inspiration teaching brings to our lives, and we feel privileged to get to share this educational journey with your children. Between the two of us, we have a combined 16 years of teaching experience and we bring that experience with us to every lesson and interaction we have with you and your child. Our diverse passions are frequently incorporated in our classroom and we love bringing the outside world in.  Megan is drawn to and loves teaching art, science, singing, and gardening. Erin loves playing her ukulele and singing with the students, teaching Spanish, and delving deeper into reading and writing. We both have our children here at Compass and feel truly lucky to be an integral part of this amazing community. Thank you for joining us on this journey as we help your children find their passions and experience the importance of becoming a life-long learner.
