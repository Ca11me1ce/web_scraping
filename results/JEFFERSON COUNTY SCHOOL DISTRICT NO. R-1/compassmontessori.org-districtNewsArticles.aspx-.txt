Holy cow, Compass Community!  You made some old gamblers' hearts sing.
					Posted On: Thursday, April 26, 2018				
We asked you to bet on
 a goat's elimination habits--and have 
friends and family to do the same--you put your money where their...um...business is.
We invited you to put on Western duds and come to a couple of hootenannies--

We urged you to strengthen the Compass community by supporting auctions, cattle raise, and a tribute
 to founding parent Laurie Hickenlooper--
you blew us away.
