Ms. Emily    
I am a Montessori child at heart! I grew up in Wisconsin and went to Waukesha Montessori School for many years. I have great memories from my experiences as a child in a Montessori classroom. I am so honored to be giving others the opportunity to learn from a Montessori environment.
I went to college in Montana for Environmental Studies and Sustainable Agriculture. I spent a lot of my time in Missoula teaching young children about farming and how our food grows. It was then I decided that I wanted to take hands-on learning into my career choice. When I finished my undergraduate degree, I moved to Maryland to pursue my Master's in Education and AMI Primary Certification. 
My first year of teaching was at a public Montessori school in Washington, D.C. I loved my time in the city, but I quickly realized I missed mountain life. I ended up finding a job here in Colorado and haven't looked back since. 
I love to spend my free time gardening, baking, walking my dogs in the mountains and exploring this beautiful state with my family! This is my third year as a lead teacher here and I am so honored to be a part of the Compass community! 
Mr. Eric
   Eric grew up in Golden and loves being in Colorado! He has a been a member of the Compass community for three years. He has a beautiful wife Ashley who works at the Golden campus in the high school. Their son Arlo goes to school at the Golden Children's House.
  In his free time he loves riding his bike (no really, he is always on his bike), taking care of plants and spending time with his family. We are so luck to have him as part of the Forest Room!
Ms. Colleen
   Colleen has been a part of the Compass community for quite some time, almost 9 years now between volunteering and working! She has two wonderful children who attend the elementary and farm school programs. She loves the Montessori philosophy and is such an asset to our team.
  When she isn't at work she enjoys spending time with her husband John, cooking delicious Cajun meals, reading a good book, staying active and meeting new people!
