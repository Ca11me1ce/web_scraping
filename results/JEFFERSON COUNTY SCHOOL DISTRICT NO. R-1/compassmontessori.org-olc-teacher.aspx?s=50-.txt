Welcome to the Fire Room classroom page!
We are an upper elementary community that engages students in thoughtful learning and meaningful work. We have a strong belief in continued service in our classroom and beyond. Our desire is to cultivate self-motivated, capable and inspiring individuals who will share their talents with the world. 
Communication
Our primary means of communication is through email, which we check before and after school during planning time (7:30-8:00 and 3:00-3:30). If you have an urgent need or need to communicate about same-day pickup, please call the office and/or our classroom. Our classroom phone is only answered during regular school hours. We do not monitor our voicemail so please email outside of school hours. If you have any questions or concerns beyond logistics we are happy to schedule a meeting after school to speak in person.
