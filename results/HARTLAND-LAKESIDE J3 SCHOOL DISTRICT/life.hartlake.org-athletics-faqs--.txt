Athletics FAQs
What are Intramural Sports?
Intramural sports or intramurals are recreational sports organized within a set geographic area. The term derives from the Latin wordsintra muros meaning “within walls”,[1] and was used to indicate sports matches and contests that took place among teams from “within the walls” of an ancient city (as opposed to a varsity team which competed with teams from other cities and towns). – Wikipedia
When is a sports physical needed?
A sports Physical is reqired by Hartland Lakeside district to play for all 5th – 8th grade AMSAC conference sports. A sports physical is good for 2 years. Contact District Nurse Ann Marie Meisner to see if your child is up to date.
Payment Information
You can pay check, cash, or 
eFUNDS
Volunteer coaches may get there child’s athletic fee waived. Volunteer Coaching is limited, and parents are selected based on coaching Experience. All volunteer coaches also must be on the district volunteer list. Contact Michele Davis for more information.
Families in need of financial assistance should also contact Michele Davis for more information.
Where does the money go?
The fee contributes to the cost of uniforms, awards, game and practice equipment, field preparation, and coaching and instruction.
Is there financial support for my child?
We personally feel that every child should have the opportunity to participate in our program. If you are a parent/guardian who needs financial assistance to cover the cost of your child/children to participate, please email John Nekich at 
k5athletics@hartlake.org
How can I volunteer?
Parents: If your son or daughter plays on a team you can volunteer to be a Coach! All coaches must go through a NYSCA Coaching training. All parent volunteers should see Michelle Davis at NSMS for district volunteer information.
Students: Middle school students can volunteer to run the scoreboard duing basketball games.
What should I bring?
Most practices and games are in the mornings, and outdoors, It is reccommended student have the following things available.
Athletic Clothing: Students are now athletes and should dress like them. Jeans are never proper attire for sports. It is best to dress to the weather, and dress warm, because layers can always be taken off. Knit hats are good to keep the head warm for all sports during cold mornings. Some sports have specific things kids need to wear for their own safety.
Soccer – Shin Guards (outdoor soccer shoes optional)
Flag football – Mouth Guard
Change of clothes: Students will be allowed time to get ready for there school day. Include an extra pair of dry socks, and even a change of shoes.
A duffle bag to hold all of the stuff
Plastic bags to put wet stuff in when practices and games are over
Medications: Have a plan with the school nurse. Inhalers and Epi-pens should be easy for coaches to access.
Water bottle and snack to have after practice and games. Please follow the district food policy!
Where can I check for cancellations?
Bad weather will be the ultimate factor in which games and practices will procede outdoors. Bad weather will alter the location of the event to inside the gym where games and rules will be modified for the number of participants.
Games will not be rescheduled!
All games and practices will be cancelled coinciding with district school cancelations. For example no games would occur on a snow day.
