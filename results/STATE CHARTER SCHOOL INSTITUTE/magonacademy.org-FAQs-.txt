FAQs
What is a Charter School
A charter school is a public school of choice. Charter schools receive funding the same way that traditional public schools do, yet they are free from many of the regulations that govern traditional public schools. Administrators at charter schools have more authority to make decisions about learning methodologies, curriculum, staff – essentially every aspect of the school. In exchange for greater autonomy, charter schools are subject to greater accountability. In other words, charter schools must prove that they are staying true to their mission, program, goals, etc.
Do I have to pay tuition?
No. All charter schools, including RFMA, are tuition-free.
