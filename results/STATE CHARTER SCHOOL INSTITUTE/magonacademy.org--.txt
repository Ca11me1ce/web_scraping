Mission
The RFMA colectivo takes absolute responsibility to prepare all students for high school, college, and life- regardless of home language or background- by employing high expectations, a profound passion for teaching and learning, and an emphasis on social consciousness. Magonistas succeed not by chance, but rather through hard work, preparation, and urgency. By embracing our cultural heritage, RFMA educators work collectively to inspire our students to be champions in the classroom, on the tennis court and chess board, in college, and beyond.
