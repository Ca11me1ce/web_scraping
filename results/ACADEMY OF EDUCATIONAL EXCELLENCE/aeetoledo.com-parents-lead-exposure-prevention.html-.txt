LEAD EXPOSURE PREVENTION
Prevent Children’s Exposure to Lead
​
Lead poisoning can be prevented. The key is to keep children from coming in contact with lead. If children are lead poisoned they must be treated. Learn how to prevent children’s exposure to lead.  There are many ways you can reduce children's exposure to lead before they are harmed. Lead hazards in a child's environment must be identified and controlled or removed safely. Lead is invisible to the naked eye and has no smell.
