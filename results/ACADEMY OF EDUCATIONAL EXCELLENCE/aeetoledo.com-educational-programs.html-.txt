English Language Arts / Literac
y
Our English Language Arts Program is keyed to the notion that reading and writing are components of one process and that each supports the growth of the other.  
Students spend extended periods of time reading and discussing literature, and have continuous, repeated exposure to the process of writing.  In this manner we are building the skills and developing the interest and confidence needed to support lifelong readers and writers, as well as the skills and strategies to ensure success in the middle school and beyond.
​
MATHEMATICS
​Our goal for mathematics instruction is to produce students who recognize and appreciate the mathematical  components of their world and the important role that mathematics will play in their future.  We strive to develop student fluency with numbers supported by a strong mathematical vocabulary and solid skill base. 
SCIENCE
​Our standards based science curriculum is built on the belief that science is a hands-on inquiry-based collaborative endeavor.
SOCIAL STUDIES
​We consider our Social Studies curriculum to be an opportunity to promote a culturally sensitive historical perspective and to inspire civic-minded participation through community service.
​VISUAL AND PERFORMING ARTS
Our curriculum exposes students to the arts in two different ways: within the academic classroom setting, and in weekly subject-specific arts instructions in visual arts and music.
Location
Our school is located at: 
728 Parkside Boulevard
 Toledo, OHIO 43607
(former St. Hyacinth School and IMANI)
