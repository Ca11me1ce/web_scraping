The Seven Habits Tree
Habit 1 — Be ProactiveYou're in ChargeI am a responsible person. I take initiative. I choose my actions, attitudes, and moods. I do not blame others for my wrong actions. I do the right thing without being asked, even when no one is looking.
Habit 2 — Begin With the End in MindHave a PlanI plan ahead and set goals. I do things that have meaning and make a difference. I am an important part of my classroom and contribute to my school’s mission and vision. I look for ways to be a good citizen.
Habit 3 — Put First Things FirstWork First, Then PlayI spend my time on things that are most important. This means I say no to things I know I should not do. I set priorities, make a schedule, and follow my plan. I am disciplined and organized.
Habit 4 — Think Win-WinEveryone Can WinI balance courage for getting what I want with consideration for what others want. I make deposits in others’ Emotional Bank Accounts. When conflicts arise, I look for Third Alternatives.
Habit 5 — Seek First to Understand, Then to Be UnderstoodListen Before You TalkI listen to other people’s ideas and feelings. I try to see things from their viewpoints. I listen to others without interrupting. I am confident in voicing my ideas. I look people in the eyes when talking.
Habit 6 — SynergizeTogether Is BetterI value other people’s strengths and learn from them. I get along well with others, even people who are different from me. I work well in groups. I seek out other people’s ideas to solve problems because I know that by teaming with others, we can create better solutions than anyone of us can alone. I am humble.
Habit 7 — Sharpen the SawBalance Feels BestI take care of my body by eating right, exercising, and getting sleep. I spend time with family and friends. I learn in lots of ways and lots of places, not just at school. I find meaningful ways to help others
Unexpected LEadership
Helping children succeed in school and life can be overwhelming, particularly when they are trying to cope with challenges in life. This video shows a beautiful partnership between a Leader in Me school and a home that helped empower two sisters with personal life and leadership skills they are now using to discover their potential, help others, and find hope.
