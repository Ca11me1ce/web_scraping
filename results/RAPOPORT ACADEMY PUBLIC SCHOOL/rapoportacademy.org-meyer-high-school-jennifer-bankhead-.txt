College Visit Information
Under §25.087(b-2), a district may excuse the absence of a student who is a junior or senior for the purpose of visiting an accredited institution of higher education if the district adopts a policy to determine when an absence will be excused for that purpose and a procedure to verify the visit.
Students are encouraged to visit colleges of interest but must have the absence excused in advance. Below is a College Visit Form and a list of College Visit Questions to ask perspective colleges.
