Mater Lakes Academy had fourty-two students that competed at the Future Business Leaders of America’s State Leadership Conference.  The FBLA SLC was held March 15th – 18th in Orlando.
“The students spent several weeks preparing for their state competition especially the students that had not competed before,” said Mr. Giovanni Lorenzo, FBLA Sponsor.
This is the first time that Mater Lakes Academy has had eight students qualify during the State Leadership Conference to attend the National Competition. Katheryn Kalouf, Isabella Milanes, and Rosa Aleman placed in first in the E-Business category.  Simon Kato, Derek Velez, and Natalie Lopez, placed in second place in Mobile Application Design.

FBLA will have created partnerships with industry leaders to design and judge their competitive events.  Students achieving national ranking can earn scholarships through FBLA and their partners.
“It is amazing what our students have been able to accomplish over the years, it seems like each year we have more and more students qualify,” said Mr. Rene Rovirosa, Principal.
