Frequently Asked Questions
Community Service Project
 Parents and Students, 
The completion of a Community Service Project is a graduation requirement for all students. If students plan early and follow through with their responsibilities it will enhance their opportunities for a successful and meaningful project. Attached, please find a copy of the Miami-Dade County Public School’s Community Service information. 
Please read carefully and follow the directions for completion. 
We encourage you to: 
•Assist your son/daughter to complete their community service project as early as possible or by the first semester in his/her senior year. 
•Assist your son/daughter in selecting a location from within his/her community that has bee pre-approved by the counselor or a non-for-profit organization. 
•Remind your son/daughter to get their employer/mentor’s signature and/or a statement letter acknowledging their service. 
•It is due by the end of the first semester (before the winter break) of the student's senior year. 
•Check your son/daughter’s student history/course credit analysis form for completion of all graduation requirements. 
•Make at least 3 copies of this information for your records. 
Please be advised that no senior will participate in graduation activities without a hundred percent completion of all graduation requirements. If you need additional information, please have your son/daughter request assistance from their Social Studies Instructor and/or call our School Counselor at (305) 698-8000. 
Thank you 
PLEASE NOTE: CLASS OF 2014 MUST TURN IN THEIR COMMUNITY SERVICE PROJECT BY DECEMBER 15TH.
