Dear Parents:
I wish to take this opportunity to express mypersonal appreciation for everything students, parents, and staff havedone to make the previous school year an outstanding year. We have pulledtogether to work as a team to improve our school’s academic success andachievement. We have continued to provide high quality academic andextra-curricular programs at Mater Lakes Academy, as evidenced by thelarge number of students being recognized and receiving awards andscholarships. As we approach the beginning of the new school year, welook forward to the challenges with a renewed sense of enthusiasmand vigor!
What an exciting time to be here at Mater LakesAcademy. As we move forward, many important events are yet to come. This is thetime, we need to all come together to help us encourage your son or daughter tocontinue his/her focus on academics and appropriate behavior. With our highlyqualified instructional staff, we expect all students to be challenged tomaximum to reach their best potential. Besides the academic mission of ourschool, we expect all students from all grade levels to participate in ournumerous activities and sports culminating in events to celebrate studentachievement and success. 
With our continued focus towards the future ofMater Lakes Academy, we want to encourage everyone to become a part of ourschool. Our teachers and administrative staff are proud to be a part of such anexceptional school and community. As we continue to work together, I know wewill accomplish a great deal more and make Mater Lakes an institutional pillarwithin our community. 
Thank you for your support.
