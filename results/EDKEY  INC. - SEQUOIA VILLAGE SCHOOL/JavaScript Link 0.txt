Welcome to Sequoia Village School
Show Low, Arizona
"Building a Better World One Student at a Time"
Sequoia Village School is a K-12, tuition-free, Arizona charter school. We offer highly qualified teachers and academics that exceed Arizona State Standards in an environment of differentiated instruction. Our school is small, with only a few hundred students, so they can receive the individual attention they require. We offer transportation, free breakfast and lunch for all students, a free after-school program (including sports, music, STEM, and tutoring), and programs for students who are accelerated learners.
We thank you for your interest in Sequoia Village!
