"Underwater Fireworks," "Burn It Up," "Mutant Plants," and "Venom" are not summer blockbuster movies � they are titles of some of the amazingly creative science fair projects judged March 3 at the Northeast Arizona Regional Science Fair.
The Navajo County Education Service Agency held the seventh annual Regional Science Fair at the Performing Arts Center at Northland Pioneer College in Snowflake. The fair broke several records this year; total number of projects entered, total number of schools entered, and total number of categories with projects.
Students entered projects from the following schools across the White Mountain region. Northland Pioneer College awarded a record number of $500 tuition scholarships to seven excellent high school students: Erica Adams (Sequoia Village), Maya Denham (Sequoia Village), LaBelle LaFrance (Ganado), Preston Orton (Sequoia Village), Taylor Slick (Sequoia Village), Karah Adams (Sequoia Village) and Sierra Waddell (Sequoia Village).
The first place winners in grades five through high school were given a $50 cash card to assist with going to the Arizona Science and Engineering Fair scheduled for late March in Phoenix. First place winners in grades third through fourth were given $10 gift cards.
The following are the list of local winners:

Navajo County Education Service Agency officials say the Science Fair would not have been possible without the 27 judges who spent hours giving feedback to the students and the support of the following organizations: Northland Pioneer College, White Mountain Nature Center, TRACKS, St. Mary of the Angels Church, Washington Federal Bank, and congregational members of the Community Presbyterian Church of Pinetop. The White Mountain Gem and Mineral Club also made a special donation in memory of one of their beloved members, John "Gator" Mierzwik.
