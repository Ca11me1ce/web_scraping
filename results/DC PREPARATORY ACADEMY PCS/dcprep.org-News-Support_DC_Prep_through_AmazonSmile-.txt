Support DC Prep through AmazonSmile
December 10 2013 | School News
With the 2013 holiday shopping season underway, consider supporting DC Prep as you make purchases for family and friends on Amazon.com. It’s easy! Simply shop via 
smile.amazon.com
 and choose “DC Preparatory Academy” as your charity of choice (type in “DC Prep” in the charity search 
box – DC Prep is the first result).
When shopping on AmazonSmile’s site, the company will donate 0.5% of the total purchase price to your designated charity. The shopping experience remains the same on the company’s website, as do prices. Additionally, there is no cap on the amount Amazon will donate, and almost every product available for purchase on Amazon is eligible – which means there are literally millions of ways to support DC Prep!
So when you’re making your holiday purchases on Amazon this year, please be sure to 
support DC Prep – the highest-performing network of public charter schools in the nation’s capital
!
