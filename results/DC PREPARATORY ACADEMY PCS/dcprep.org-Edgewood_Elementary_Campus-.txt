Edgewood Elementary Campus
Dear EEC Community,  
It’s hard to believe, but we already finished the first semester of DC Prep’s 15th academic year! I’m continually proud of the hard work Preppies, team members, and families put in – every day. I hope that you take a moment over Winter Break to reflect on the incredible growth you’ve made and to relax and recharge with family and friends. 
Avise Hayes
Principal

What Parents are Saying
“We initially chose DC Prep because of its track record with great test scores and teachers. They follow kids through high school and college. We want to cultivate productive citizens and the school we chose has the same philosophy. We're completely committed to the school, and the school to us.”
Erika Harrell, Parent
