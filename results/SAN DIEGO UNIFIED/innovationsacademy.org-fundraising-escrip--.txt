Gift Cards through Great Lakes Scrip:
Our Parents Association Group has organized one of the best fundraisers ever! Great Lakes Scrip/Gift Cards works for everyone. Parents, friends and family can all purchase gift cards for shopping where they already shop or for birthday and holiday gifts and we get a percentage anywhere from 5-16% of your purchase.  20 families enrolled can potentially earn our school $19,520!  That would make a big difference.
How it Works
You purchase gift cards from Innovations Academy at face value.  IA purchases those cards from Great Lakes Scrip Center at a reduced price.  The difference is an instant rebate for IA.  It is really that simple.  Help our school raise critical funding by purchasing gift cards from IA through the list of extensive national retailers.
Some of the participating retailers:
Michaels, JoAnns Fabric, Barnes & Noble, CVS Pharmacy, Home Depot, Lowes, Edwards, Regal and AMC movie theaters, Staples, JCPenney, Macy’s, and Sears or restaurants like Applebees, Boston Market, Chili’s, Domino’s Pizza, Macaroni Grill, Red Robin, Soup Plantation , TGI Friday’s, or Uno Chicago Grill.  Even things like Cheveron and Hyatt hotels are on the list. If we do not have what you are looking for in stock, we will assist you in ordering through Great Lakes Scrip.
For a complete list of retailers please see the
