Before & After School
A. Before and After School Program
At Innovations Academy we care very deeply that your children are safe while you can not be with them. Please let us know your needs and ask for information about before and after school camp options at the front office.  There are two components to our BEFORE CARE program: supervision for students from 7-9 and Extracurricular Before and After School Activities. See below for information about both.
Extended Care Camp
Before School
7:00-8:45 a.m.
After School
Mondays: 12:30-6:00 p.m.
Tuesdays-Fridays: 3:15-6:00 p.m.
Before Care Supervision
Innovations Academy believes that with freedom comes responsibility. We consider our campus to be a safe place where students are given many choices. We also believe in safety and supervision. We need your support in communicating with all family members the following procedures for our before care program.
Before care begins at 7:00 a.m. No child is to be dropped off before 7:00 a.m.
All students arriving on campus between 7:00-8:30 a.m. are required to sign into before care, whether enrolled or not.
All students arriving before 8:30 a.m. will be asked to enroll in the before care program.
All students arriving on campus will sign in and be automatically placed in the before care program.
All people coming to campus in the morning before 8:30 a.m. will enter the campus through the gate north of the main gate. The main gate will open at 8:30 a.m.
All students on campus at any time before school begins are required to follow the instructions given by all staff members. Staff members include teachers, teacher assistants and office staff.
If a student ignores or defies instructions given by staff before school, they will not be allowed on campus prior to 8:30 a.m. for one week.
If they demonstrate a continual inability to follow instructions, they will be asked to stay home until 9:00 a.m. and escorted onto campus by their parent.
