I am the proud mother of four marvelous children. Three of my children have attended I.A. Two are now in high school, one is in college, and my earliest inspiration for I.A. is now a working adult.
I homeschooled my children for 16 years, organized multiple homeschool fairs, and ran a homeschooling cooperative. I have lived in Mexico and Costa Rica and speak Spanish fluently. I love to read, listen to music, travel and spend as much time as possible with my family.
I am very interested in improving the world by supporting, building and creating interest based learning environments.  If you ever have any thoughts on this topic, stop by my office for a chat. I am always excited about continuing to build this creation and seeing how far we can stretch our hearts and our imaginations. I expect the journey to be unforgettable.

I have taught at Innovations Academy for seven years. This will be my first year as Assistant Director, and in this position I am looking forward to supporting and coaching teachers and working with students and parents as well. As a teacher, the basis of my teaching philosophy was, and continues to be, my firm belief that children benefit from a student-centered classroom where they are active and learn by doing. Students are co-creators in the learning process, with their own ideas and concerns that deserve attention and consideration. I believe an important role for teachers is to help their students discover the tools that will enable them to achieve their highest potential.
I earned a bachelor’s degree in philosophy from Tulane University and a Masters in Education from the University of San Diego. I am a parent of young twin girls, and when I have spare time, I enjoy exercising, dabbling in technology, reading, and experiencing different parts of the world whenever I can. In my new role, I am so excited to continue to be a part of the Innovations Academy community, where the emphasis on self-expression, compassionate connection, and purposeful learning is second to none!

My love of children is what brought me to Innovations Academy. Prior to joining IA in January 2009, I was a stay-at-home mom for 16 years. I have two daughters: Elise, a recent graduate of USC (Fight On!), an aspiring voice over and actor residing in Los Angeles, and Lauren, a cosmetologist in Alpine, CA.
I am a native San Diegan. I received my BA in Psychology from San Diego State University, and I am a certified Positive Discipline Parenting and Classroom Educator. I am returning to San Diego State this fall to pursue a Master’s degree in Child Development.
In my free time, I enjoy quilting, reading, and playing card and board games with my family.
I love my job at IA! Each day is different and there is never a dull moment!! I am grateful for the wonderful opportunity to interact with our students and their families. IA is more than just a “school”, it is truly a “community”.
I look forward to another exciting school year!

I have been working at IA for a year now! I am excited to start my second year here, and I can’t wait to see what this school year brings! I had a son who went to Innovations, and graduated last year, and I am happy that I get to stay! I love working in the office because I get to see all of the wonderful parents and students who come by, and there is always something interesting going on! This is going to be a great year!

I am Tina McGinnis. I work in the office assisting students and parents. I have worked at Innovations Academy since the school started in September of 2008. I previously homeschooled my two sons. My son Noah attended Innovations Academy since the school opened. He is graduating from eighth grade and planning to go to Health Sciences High and Middle College. I have seen him grow at I.A. from a non writer with weak math skills to a confident writer and speaker and enthusiastically preparing for algebra.
