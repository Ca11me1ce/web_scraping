Sick Day Independent Study Contract
Innovations Academy is funded based on Average Daily Attendance (ADA).  When a student is absent, for any reason, our funding is impacted. We ask our parents to complete a short term independent study program for days their child is absent so that: 1) the student will have the chance to gain academic practice while absent and 2)  we can receive funding for the day of absence. Please use this form. Contact our front office for work which can be emailed to you.
