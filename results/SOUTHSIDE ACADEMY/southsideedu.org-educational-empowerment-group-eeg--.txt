Educational Empowerment Group (EEG)
South Side Academy is a part of the Educational Empowerment Group (EEG) network of schools. EEG was founded in 2014 by two lifelong educators, Reggie Ray and Wendy Rydarowicz, with the intent of managing schools serving at-risk students who need high quality school alternatives.   Our objective is to bring multiple options to families in diverse geographies so that students have multiple pathways to success.  All students have different needs, learn at various rates and have different learning styles. No one educational program is appropriate for all students.  As a result of this diversity, EEG has risen to provide a successful alternative. 
EEG offers a holistic approach to education that encompasses the whole body, mind and emotional well-being of a student.  We adapt our programs and practices to each student’s strengths and provide the support system that is required for maximum achievement. EEG desires to be the school that each individual student requires.
EEG’s vision involves a hierarchy of needs that we have identified as relevant to the educational process.  This model is based upon Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs that consist of, in ascending order, physical and biological needs, safety needs, emotional and love needs, self-esteem needs, and finally self-actualization.  EEG will increase academic performance by providing programs and systems that address each student’s hierarchy of needs.  These programs connect the family and community with the school, which will set the foundation for academic achievement. The unique EEG model is built upon the following Seven Pillars of Success:
