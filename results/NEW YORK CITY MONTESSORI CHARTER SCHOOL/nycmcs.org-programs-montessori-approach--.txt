Montessori Approach
Although the Montessori approach doesn’t utilize a typical “curriculum” as defined by a conventional public school system, it is absolutely aligned with the National and New York State Common Core Standards to ensure compliance with essential testing and other requirements. Beyond that adherence, the educational experience is unlike any other.
Montessori at-a-glance:
Is based on the principles and techniques developed by Dr. Maria Montessori
Uses a child’s natural motivation to learn – and stimulates that motivation
Engages children with seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling, touching
Understands that movement can greatly enhance thinking and learning
Concentrates on the whole child – physical, social, emotional, cognitive
Respects each child’s individual differences with tailored instruction
Encourages freedom to make personal choices
Allows students to work independently at their own unique pace
Utilizes specially-designed, progressively-sequenced learning materials
Assesses each student’s performance and adjusts teaching accordingly
Meets and exceeds all New York State educational testing standards
Prepares students for 21st Century careers
Firmly believes that no child is unteachable
