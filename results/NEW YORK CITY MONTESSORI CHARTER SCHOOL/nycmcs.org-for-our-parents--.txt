RESOURCES FOR PARENTS
GET TO KNOW US!
On the first and third Wednesday of each month (except for May 2nd)  we have a school tour, beginning at 9:00 am. Prospective parents and anyone else who wants know about our school are cordially invited. No need to make an appointment. Just show up!
Key NYCMCS documents.
These documents should answer most questions about our school’s history, its procedures and policies, as well as our plans and activities for the year:

Commitments for Excellence
The NYCMCS considers education to be a joint venture where the school and the family work together as a team. To do this, we have drawn up a series of expectations necessary to achieve an excellent education, some referring to the school and its staff and others to our parents.  Parents are given a copy of the school’s commitments at the beginning of the school year and are expected to sign their own commitments.  Use the following links to read what the school and parents commit to.

                                   FAMILY ASSOCIATION
Our volunteer Family Association is made up of dedicated parents who have been a part of our school community for many years.  On September 19th, we held the first meeting of the Association this school year. Since the children of last year’s officers graduated from 5th grade in June, there are several vacant positions on the Executive Board of the Association. In the meeting, those present were invited to propose themselves or other people for the vacant positions and received a description of the duties related to each one. Here are the minutes of the meeting:

Elections were held in the November meeting of the Family Association and new Board members elected. They are:
President:   Tiffany Stokes-Dinkins
Vice-President Randy Mendoza
Secretary:  Melissa Velazquez
Treasurer:  Sabrina Bryant
Current or prospective parents can reach the Family Association via email at families@nycmcs, or contact the Family Association via their Facebook page:
