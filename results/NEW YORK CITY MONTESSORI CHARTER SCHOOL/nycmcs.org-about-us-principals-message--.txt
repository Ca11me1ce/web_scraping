Principal’s Message
Dear Montessori Families,
As the principal of New York City Montessori Charter School, I welcome you to the 2017-2018 school year! I am eagerly anticipating a successful and rewarding year. I am looking forward to working with our dedicated staff, parents, and community partners to provide an exceptional educational experience for all of our NYCMCS students.
I am excited and honored to work with the NYCMCS family for what I know will be an amazing school year. Those of you who know me know I truly have an open door policy, and I welcome your questions, concerns, and input at any time. As parents of two students in the NYCMCS community, my wife and I are thrilled to share this journey with you all.
It is a great day to be a part of the New York City Montessori Charter School Team and Family!
Abeku Hayes
