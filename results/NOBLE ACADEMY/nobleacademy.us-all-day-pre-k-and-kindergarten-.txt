All Day Pre-K and Kindergarten 
We love having the opportunity to take your child all day and every day of the week. They will experience a full day of fun filled learning and they will enjoy the extra curricular activities that are offered, such as Gym, Art, Music & Hmong Literacy. Not only will you be able to focus on completing errands, tasks, and/or work, but your child will get the opportunity to expand their mind and continue to grow academically each and every day through interaction with staff and other students. May we be the place where your child begins his/her journey - we are paving the way for their success!
Please contact one of our office personnel for further questions and/or for enrollment applications.
