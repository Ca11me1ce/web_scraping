Experience:
It has been said, “Who you are begins with what you do.  You can’t change your past, but you can change your future.”  Dr. Chang’s dream is to do just that—change the future through her role as a K-12 public school leader.
Dr. Chang has a wide array of experiences of over twenty years in both public and charter public school systems as a teacher, coordinator, and administrator.  One of her core beliefs is that it takes everyone working together to provide our students with the best education possible. With this said, she characterizes her leadership style to be collective, with a growth mindset and democratic in nature.
People often refer to Dr. Chang as a leader of integrity.  She has a strong desire to improve her leadership skills on a daily basis.  Dr. Chang is a leader with a strong sense of direction, and a spirit of excellence. She believes much of her success is due to the value she places on getting input from the stakeholders in her organization when making hard critical decisions. She welcomes the opportunity to learn from others, and receive input to help make the best decisions possible for those she serves. She is a firm believer that effective leaders are not only visionaries but are life-long learners. Learning is a continuous process with no ends.
