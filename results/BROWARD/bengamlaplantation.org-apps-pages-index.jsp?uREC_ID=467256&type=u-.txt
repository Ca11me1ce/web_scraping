														Shalom parents, teachers and students.
We are very excited towards this upcoming year! We will be having fun & educational activities 
about Israel throughout the year. The students will have an opportunity to learn all about different places/people and cultures in Israel.
We would love to share our personal story of our lives in Israel with the students, encourage them to learn about Israel and strengthen their connection to the country of Israel. We are looking forward to have an amazing year!
