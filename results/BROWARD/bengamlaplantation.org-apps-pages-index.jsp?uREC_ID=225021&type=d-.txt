Ben Gamla Charter School South is serviced by Academica.
Academica is one of the nation’s longest-serving and most successful charter school service and support organizations. The Company was founded in 1999 on the principle that each charter school is a unique educational environment governed by an independent Board of Directors that best knows the right path for its school, and Academica’s mission is to facilitate that Governing Board’s vision. Academica has a proven track-record developing growing networks of high performing charter schools.
Academica’s services include facilities, finance, staffing and human resource coordination, as well as bookkeeping, budgeting, regulatory compliance and financial forecasting.
Academica serves the largest number of high-performing schools of any charter school management organization in Florida. Academica was the first company in the state to seek SACS accreditation for the schools it serves, and all of the schools it serves are either fully accredited or in the process of obtaining accreditation.
