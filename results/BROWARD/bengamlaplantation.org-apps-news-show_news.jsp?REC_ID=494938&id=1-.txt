Yearbook Ads on Sale Now!
Be sure to get a head start on your yearbook ad by going online today to purchase your ad, or pre-order your yearbook today!
This year, you can order and pay for your yearbook online, and even better, you can design your own yearbook ads online!  The ads are a great way for a parent to let their child know  how proud they are—especially for 5th and 6th graders who are reaching a special milestone, and for Kindergartners who are just beginning their journey! It’s a great way to remember all the fantastic events your child has experienced this year! Want to get started?
Go to YBLIVE.NET, click on “order online”, and find our school through the city/state search. It’s easy!
Also, please send any great pictures you have of school events to:
