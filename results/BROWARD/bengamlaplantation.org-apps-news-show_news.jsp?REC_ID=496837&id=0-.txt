Important Notice
As we have watched the tragedy unfolding at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School our hearts and prayers go out to the victims, their families, and all the students, teachers, and staff affected.
When we come together as a family, school, and community we want to assure you that our support staff will be available to speak with students if needed. Our faculty and staff will be extra vigilant and our administration will continue to be visible throughout the day in all areas of the school.
Ben Gamla Charter South has a comprehensive emergency plan in the hopes that we will never need to use it. Sadly, events like the tragedy at Stoneman Douglas show us that we must never grow complacent. We will continue to review and practice our plans with personnel and with our Plantation Police school resource officer to ensure the safety of all our students, faculty, and staff, which will always be our highest priority.
We thank all parents, students, staff and faculty who make Ben Gamla such a strong community. Let's continue to stand strong even as we grieve over this unspeakable tragedy.
