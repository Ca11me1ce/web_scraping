Climate Surveys!
We want to know what you think!  Parents and Students please complete the Climate Surveys by June 1st.
Somerset Academy would like to survey all our stakeholders to continue to work towards improving our programs and services. Please click the Climate Surveys on the links below.
It is important that we all take a few moments to complete the Climate Survey. If you are completing the survey as a parent and have more than one child at Somerset Academy, please be sure to do a separate survey for each child.
Students will be encouraged to complete 3 separate surveys during their Personalization Periods using the links below:
5/7-11:  Climate & Culture
5/14-18:  Inventories
5/21-24:  Engagement Survey
All students, parents and staff are also encouraged to do a survey based on their experiences. 
We thank you for your cooperation and support!
