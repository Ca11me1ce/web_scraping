Engrade
Engrade
 is the online program that Middle School teachers use to record students’ grades and to share information with parents. By logging in with an account linked to a student’s ID, parents can check grades and assignments at any time with a computer or mobile device. Many teachers upload copies of students’ assignments to the gradebook, so parents can open the assignment electronically and print it if desired. 
Engrade
 contains a messaging system that parents and students may use to communicate with teachers, and teachers may also send messages to entire classes, grades, or other groups.
Parents are strongly encouraged to use 
Engrade
 regularly to keep track of their students’ progress.
Information including your student’s ID and login instructions will be sent home in August. Once you have this information (or if you already have an account from previous school years), log in at:
