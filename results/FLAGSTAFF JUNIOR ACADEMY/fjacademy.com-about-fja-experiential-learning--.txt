Experiential Learning
What sets Flagstaff Junior Academy apart from other schools is our faculty’s commitment to Experiential Learning. Experiential Learning is an educational approach designed to engage each and every student as the vested decision maker in her/his own educational process.
This approach ensures that students think critically, push their own creative limits, and assume responsibility for their own social and academic growth.
Experiential Learning includes a variety of teaching styles, activities, and field trips at FJA. Our elementary school faculty members are credentialed in Montessori-based education. Our middle school faculty members focus on applied learning, simulations, and off-campus educational opportunites.
