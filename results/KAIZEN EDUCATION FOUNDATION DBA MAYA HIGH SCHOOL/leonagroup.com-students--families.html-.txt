Any child can learn just about anything when it is presented in a relevant and interesting way. 
When children believe something is important and make connections in how each lesson translates into meaning in their lives… they WILL learn it!
The Leona Group works to provide students a safe, nurturing and respectful learning environment while maintaining high standards of instruction. The overarching goal is to improve student learning and achievement in core subject areas, while maintaining a keen focus on educating the whole child. Leona students are challenged to achieve – not just academically, but as a whole child – socially, behaviorally and emotionally.
﻿Leona﻿ Group s﻿tudents are rising to these expectations!
To be in a Leona school is to be in a warm, family-friendly environment. These caring relationships, when combined with educational best-practices, effect improvements in our students’ academic progress and proficiency, including their performance on state standardized tests.
