				About Leona			
				Contact Us			
Leona grew up in a small Ohio town in a largely rural area during the early part of the 20th century. She was an outstanding student who valued school.
Leona lived a happy and productive life, but because of societal expectations, her formal education was limited to just seven years. Leona's experience mirrored that of countless other women, minorities and underprivileged.
We are proud to name our organization after Leona. Leona symbolizes our company's commitment to creating educational opportunities and opening up the schoolhouse door for all young people.
