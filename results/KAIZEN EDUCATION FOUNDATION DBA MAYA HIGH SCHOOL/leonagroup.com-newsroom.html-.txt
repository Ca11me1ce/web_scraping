​Local philanthropist encourages students to tackle obstacles 
Humberto S. Lopez talked with high school students about the importance of overcoming obstacles and pursuing their dreams.
TUCSON, Ariz. — As part of a recent grant to Youth Entrepreneurs, Humberto S. Lopez, president of the H.S. Lopez Family Foundation, visited Alta Vista High School in Tucson, sharing with students his experiences in business and the importance of giving back to their community. 
“The future of our communities is in the hands of today’s youth,” said Lopez. "There can be so many obstacles preventing our youth from reaching their fullest potential. The foundation’s donation to Youth Entrepreneurs provides opportunities these students may not have otherwise.” 
In August, the H.S. Lopez Family Foundation announced a $50,000 donation to Youth Entrepreneurs in support of programs at Alta Vista as well as Mission Heights Preparatory High School in Casa Grande. Youth Entrepreneurs equips young people with the values and vision to pursue their dreams.
“Mr. Lopez’s visit truly demonstrates his commitment to the future of our students,” said Alicia Alvarez, principal at Alta Vista High School. “His support of our school’s Youth Entrepreneurs program provides a wide range of students an opportunity to further expand economics concepts, while applying their creativity and learning business principles. Youth Entrepreneurs is a highly engaging elective class that brings application of knowledge to another level.”
Throughout the school year, Youth Entrepreneurs students will participate in fall and spring Market Days and the Big Idea event – an end-of-year pitch competition.
Lopez is a strong supporter of causes related to education, health and society's general welfare. His extensive community service work includes several board memberships at the University of Arizona and throughout the Tucson community. His efforts have been recognized by numerous organizations, including the Father's Day Council, City of Hope, the Tucson Hispanic Council, The University of Arizona Hispanic Alumni Association and the Tucson Chamber of Commerce.

The director and cast also provided a "talk-back" wrap session following the performance to reinforce the principles in the performance. 
"Personally, I get excited when our young students are exposed to new and positive experiences. They also have the layered lessons from this activity to reflect upon," said Ms. Lenora Martin, counselor at George Crockett Academy.

Arizona Business Magazine held its annual Industry Leaders of Arizona Awards on Thurs., Feb. 23; business leaders from across Arizona gathered at the Camelback Golf Club for the event. Among them were The Leona Group's founder and CEO, Dr. William Coats, his colleagues and family.
While Dr. Coats did not expect recognition at the event, he was the very deserving recipient of the Founder's Award, which goes to an individual who has founded a company that has changed its industry in positive ways.
Jody Sarchett, Senior Vice President at Lovitt & Touché, introduced the winner of the Founder's Award "This founder has been operating tuition­-free, non-profit charter schools since 1996. This founder believes in providing choices for families whose needs, for whatever reason, are not being met by their traditional district school. This founder’s educational facilities are open to all students, regardless of income, gender, race or religion. This founder is acutely aware of the fiscal and academic challenges that families, communities and educational institutions face today. As a national organization serving nearly 60 schools in five states, this founder’s company has made significant and positive strides toward improving the nation’s educational landscape, especially in high­-need urban areas. Please congratulate and welcome the winner of the Founders Award ...  Dr. William Coats."
