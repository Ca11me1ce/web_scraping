School Employees
At The Leona Group, your professional expertise is valued in small schools where teaching and learning occurs in caring, nurturing environments.
In most cases, Leona Group schools are located in communities experiencing significant economic disadvantage. Your work makes a big difference in the lives of students who need you most. One of the great things about teaching at Leona Group charter schools is being able to get really creative about how to reach and teach students.
We know that students who are excited about learning are best able to retain what they have learned. Making learning fun, relevant and hands-on creates rewarding experiences for both teachers and learners.
Leona Group teachers are unique, creative and innovative in the ways they connect with students. Professional development is encouraged - and built right into many schools' calendars. Professional, innovative working environments with room to grow are characteristic of Leona schools.
