Transparency
Did you know that charter schools receive their increased autonomy in return for 
MORE accountability and oversight
 (not less) than traditional public schools? 
At The Leona Group, we take accountability and transparency very seriously. In fact, we go above and beyond the minimum requirements in an effort to support each client board in being 100% transparent and accountable in accordance with all federal and state standards.
As part of its services to boards, The Leona Group remains current on all compliance and reporting requirements. Individuals within Leona's corporate support departments are then tasked with ensuring compliance for all schools including the timely posting/submission of hundreds of documents per school annually.
Did you know?
Every Leona Group charter school follows all applicable laws relative to transparency and public information.
