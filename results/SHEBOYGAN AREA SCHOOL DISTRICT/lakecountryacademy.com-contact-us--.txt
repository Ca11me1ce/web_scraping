Visit Us
Lake Country Academy loves visitors! We are proud of our students, staff and campus.  Everyone is welcome to visit. Families are always welcome to come into the classroom, volunteer and host events that are open to our students.  
We offer Open Houses on a weekly basis during the months of December, January, February and periodically throughout the rest of the year. We encourage prospective parents and community members to attend. We are proud to show our school anytime but suggest starting with an Open House to ensure time for a complete tour and comprehensive overview of the school.
Are you a business owner?
