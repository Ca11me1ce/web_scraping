SASD Lunch Program
School Nutrition
Lake Country Academy contracts with the Sheboygan Area School District to provide a hot lunch program.  Hot lunches, which include milk, are $2.60 and milk alone is $0.40. Students may also bring their own lunch. Electronic cards are used as a "debit card" for hot lunch and milk. The cards will be scanned each time your child uses it.  When funds are low on the account, parents will be notified.  To make payments directly, please visit

Students eat lunch in the cafeteria and an area is designated “Nut-Free”. Snacks and treats to be eaten in the classroom must be free of nuts/nut traces. It is critical that all classrooms are nut-free and safe for all.
