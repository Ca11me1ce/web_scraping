Parents
Parent volunteerism plays an important part of Lake Country Academy's community. Parents assist in many areas of school operations including helping in the classrooms, leading extra-curricular activities, supervising the lunch program, managing library duties, holding committee positions, etc.  Our team approach with parents at LCA helps creates a positive and nurturing environment.
