1. Eligibility
In order to enroll in PALCS, students must…
Be in Grades K-12
Kindergarten students are accepted based on the age requirements of their local district. This is usually 5 years old by a certain date in the fall of the current school year; please check with your local district.
According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, “school age is the period of a child’s life from the earliest admission age to a school district’s kindergarten program until graduation from high school or the end of the school term in which a student reaches the age of 21 years, whichever occurs first.”
Be Pennsylvania Residents
Students must have a permanent residence in Pennsylvania.  Families are welcome to travel, but must spend the majority of the school year in Pennsylvania.
Not Be Expelled
Students may not be expelled from their current district. 
Students who have temporarily dropped out of school may return to public schooling with PALCS to finish their high school education, provided the student is under 21 years of age and will graduate before the end of their 21st year.
