Ways to Meet Us
Online Information Sessions
Learn how our cyber school works by attending a live online session in the same chat rooms used for school. Also, see our school site, find out about the enrollment process, and get helpful answers. A great way to experience PALCS!
Information Sessions
Meet us in person to learn about PA Leadership. We will cover the same content that is presented in the online information session, and you will also get a tour of whichever PALCS office is closer to you: West Chester or Pittsburgh.
Events
A fair, festival or location to meet a PALCS representative at a table or booth. No PALCS reservation is required, though when we are part of a larger event, there may be event admission. You can usually find some fun PALCS freebies at these events!
Need help? Don’t see sessions or events in your area? Need a different time? Want a private session and tour? We’re happy to set up a meeting with you!
