PA Leadership strives to provide our families with the best education available. To achieve that goal, our teachers are encouraged to review curriculum from many different publishers and select the materials that work best in our cyber environment. Our teachers then create and post their own standards-aligned lessons. Students complete this work within a time window, with their teachers readily available to help via click, call or chat, and then receive grades and feedback from their teachers.
Our cyber school curriculum follows the PA standards aligned system and meets or exceeds all 
Pennsylvania Core Standards
. Materials are selected from multiple publishers: Glencoe, Harcourt, Holt, Houghton Mifflin, Macmillan/McGraw-Hill, Pearson/Prentice Hall, Scott Foresman and more. Students receive physical textbooks, storybooks and novels and, in many cases, access to the identical books online. Special kits are provided for our art and science courses. Additionally, our courses utilize the fullest extent of supplemental educational resources available on the Internet.
Our curriculum materials serve as the foundation at PALCS, but the greatest strength of this curriculum resides with the teachers who work with this material – they develop their own unique courses, deliver instruction, make and grade assignments, and interact with students on a daily basis. After reading about our courses, you may wish to meet the 
teachers
