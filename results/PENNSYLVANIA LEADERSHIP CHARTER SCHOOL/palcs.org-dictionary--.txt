A
Academic Advisor
A staff member who assists PALCS families with organization and scheduling, will facilitate communication and will provide additional support.
Accountability
As a public school, PALCS is subject to all the standard requirements of a public school – state standardized testing, PA Core standards — plus additional audits and communications with the PA Department of Education.
Advanced Courses
Courses available at all levels throughout PALCS. In elementary school, advanced lessons are incorporated directly into all courses and teachers will select students to receive these lessons based on their performance. Starting in middle school, advanced courses may be available as separate courses students receive based on parent/teacher/guidance recommendation or performance, or advanced lessons may be incorporated directly into standard core courses. Advanced coursework is either College-Prep or Honors/AP level in high school. Advanced students may also be interested in pursuing the University Scholars Program.
Advanced Ideas Center (AIC)
A PALCS office building on Paoli Pike in West Chester, which houses our Elementary and Middle School teachers and the University Scholars Program.
Age
PALCS started operation in 2004 and accepts Pennsylvania students between the ages of 5 and 21. For Kindergarten, we accept students based on the age requirements or at the permission of the students’ local district.
Assignments
Assignments are how we measure the success and progress of a student’s learning at PALCS. Examples of assignments may be free responses, student forums, quizzes using multiple choice, true/false, fill-in-the-blank or essay question, file submissions of typed or scanned documents or pictures, audio or video recordings, or they may be interactive activities completed on other websites.
Attendance
Students must log in to the school website every Monday through Friday during the school year, excepting holidays. An excuse must be submitted by a parent if the student does not log in.
Asynchronous Instruction
PALCS primary method of instruction is asynchronous learning: lessons are created and posted by the teacher about a week in advance of the due date, and students are able to access those lessons and complete them at their own pace before the due date.
B
Blended Learning
Students learn though a mixture of both on-site and online learning. The PALCS University Scholars Program, Center for Performing and Fine Arts, and the School of Professional Studies are examples of blended learning.
Brick-and-Mortar
Term used to refer to a “traditional” school families are used to – going to sit in a classroom with a teacher and other students. This may refer to a standard public school or a charter school with a building. While PALCS is primarily a cyber school, PALCS does have brick-and-mortar components: we have both office buildings where teachers and staff work and events, and we have optional programs with on-site learning opportunities.
Book Buddies
A storytime book club for elementary students hosted every other month in the main PALCS West Chester office. Alternates monthly with Got Science.
Bridge to Student Success (BtSS)
A support system for students and families that focuses on improving school attendance and improving the consistency and quality of class work submissions.
C
Calendar
PALCS operates 180 school days from September to June. View the 
calendar.
Canvas
A portion of the PALCSchool Learning Management System. Behind-the-scenes, when students log into PALCSchool every day, their courses are hosted on Canvas. As all coursework is technically completed on Canvas, we may occasionally refer to our school website, PALCSchool, as Canvas.
Center for Performing and Fine Arts (CPFA)
An audition-based supplemental program for PALCS students in grades 6 through 12 that offers a pre-professional arts education in theatre, dance, music and fine arts. 
Learn more about CPFA.
Charter School
Pennsylvania Charter Schools receive charters, or an application which provides approval to operate, from the PDE. Charter schools are public schools of choice, meaning that families choose them for their children. Charter schools are accountable for academic results and for upholding the promises made in their charters. Charter schools can be brick-and-mortar or cyber. PALCS is a public cyber charter school.
College-Prep Courses
High school course level designed for students who are college-bound. Students should be self-motivated and dedicated to be successful at this level.
Compass Learning Courses
Educational partner that provides courses used to supplement some PALCS courses or student graduation requirements.
Core Courses
Required courses for all grade levels in English/Language Arts, Mathematics, Science, Social Studies.
Core Standards
The commonwealth of Pennsylvania does not use Common Core, but instead, uses a series of standards called PA Core. All public schools in Pennsylvania, including PALCS, teach PA Core standards. PA Core can be explored on this 
PDE website
.
Courses
Students complete all school work online in courses, including core, elective, and non-academic courses. Courses are hosted in our PALCSchool website.
Curriculum
PALCS curriculum is composed of a variety of textbooks, manipulatives and kits, websites, and original teacher-created content. Each lesson in the school is created by a PALCS teacher using text, audio, video, and interactive elements. More information about courses and curriculum is on our 
Academics page.
Cyber School
Cyber schools, also known as virtual or online schools, have students virtually “attend” school online by logging into a website and completing schoolwork independently from home. Cyber schools may be run by a local district or may be a charter school. PALCS is a public cyber charter school.
D
District
All Pennsylvania families live in a local school district, and children in those districts usually attend the local school district school. PALCS operates as something like a location-independent district, in that families may live anywhere in Pennsylvania and still attend PALCS. PALCS is funded by your tax dollars paid to your local district; when you enroll in PALCS, we will bill your local district for a certain percentage of your students’ per-pupil education funding, which will then cover our expenses at PALCS to educate your child. PALCS students may still participate in local district extra-curricular activities and sports.
Dual Enrollment
PALCS is a public K-12 school and provides a complete state-approved education; students are not permitted to be enrolled in more than one K-12 school at the same time. PALCS does have a partnership with Delaware County Community College, and at the approval of the PALCS guidance department, students meeting certain criteria may take advantage of dual enrollment programs at either of these schools to earn both high school and college credit.
E
Educational Travel
Gives students the chance to gain first-hand experience and knowledge of other regions and cultures. Certain travel opportunities will have an option of earning a half-credit through course work that can count toward the electives requirement for graduation. PALCS has traveled to over half a dozen locations both nationally and internationally.
Electives
PALCS offers elective courses to all grades, K-12. Elective courses cover subjects such as arts and humanities, business, technology and computer science, world languages and leadership.  More information about courses and curriculum is on our 
Academics page.
Elementary School
Elementary school covers grades K-5.  More information about courses and curriculum is on our 
Academics page.
Extra-Curricular Activities
Online, students can attend any of our open chats or participate in virtual clubs. In our offices, students are able to participate in recurring activities that alternate themes around holidays and fun topics. Around the state, families are welcome to attend any of the numerous field trips hosted by our teachers and parent network coordinators.
F
Field Trips
PALCS holds field trips across the state all year long. PALCS hosts, activities such as picnics, trips to Kennywood and HersheyPark, the Philadelphia and Pittsburgh zoos, the Heinz History Center, museums. We also host tours through places like the Herr’s Factory, Longwood Gardens, various farms and orchards, and meeting with community leaders like local EMS workers.
G
Google Apps (GApps)
Google Apps for Education is an integrated communication and collaboration suite that is hosted by Google and managed by PALCS.
Got Science
An interactive science club for elementary students hosted every other month in the main PALCS West Chester office. Alternates monthly with Book Buddies.
Graduation
PALCS graduates receive a tier 1 high school diploma, viewed equally as a diploma from a traditional brick-and-mortar school in Pennsylvania. PALCS hosts a cap-and-gown graduation ceremony in June at the Lancaster Mennonite School in Lancaster, PA, and is open to all PALCS graduates who wish to attend.
Guidance
PALCS has a strong guidance department, with four guidance counselors associated with elementary and middle school grades, and four high school guidance counselors that move up yearly with students, from 9th grade through graduation. Special programs also have dedicated guidance counselors. Learn more about the 
guidance department.
H
High School
PALCS high school covers grades 9-12.  More information about courses and curriculum is on our 
Academics page.
Home Facilitator
An older term from PALCS often replaced more clearly with Parent/Guardian. Roles and responsibilities of parents and guardians of PALCS students can be found on the 
Parent Responsibilities tab of the Handbook page
.
Homeschool
While PALCS students are learning at home and assisted by a parent, homeschool in Pennsylvania almost always refers to students learning under the PA Home Education Law, which does not cover charter schools. Legally, PALCS is not homeschool. Homeschool students in PA are instructed by a parent or supervisor who selects their own curriculum and presents a yearly portfolio to an evaluator; PALCS is a public school, which still follows the same standards and requirements as traditional brick-and-mortar public schools. PALCS selects the curriculum, and parents provide schoolwork assistance, but instruction comes from PA-certified teachers. As PALCS families have flexible hours, students are welcome to choose to participate in activities geared toward homeschoolers for personal enrichment.
Homework Help
Available Sunday – Thursday, 6 pm – 8 pm. Families can meet with a grade- and subject-level appropriate PALCS teacher in a virtual classroom to get help with homework.
Honors Courses
High school academic course tier for students who are excelling academically. Courses are challenging. AP courses are considered Honors-level or above.
I
Individualized Education Program (IEP)
An IEP is a document that outlines learning needs and accommodations for special education students.
Internet Service Provider (ISP)
An ISP delivers Internet to your home. Comcast and Verizon are examples of common ISPs. Families must select their own high-speed ISP before enrolling in PALCS, and have access to a wired Internet connection – PALCS laptops must occasionally be plugged directly into your ISP device (modem) to receive updates and tech support. PALCS will reimburse a capped monthly Internet payment for the months you are enrolled in the school.

K
Keystone Exams
PALCS high school students are required to complete three state-mandated Keystone exams in Literature, Biology and Algebra I after completing the corresponding courses at PALCS. Testing locations will be set up throughout the state on pre-appointed dates and proctored by PALCS teachers. Parents are required to make sure students attend and complete the Keystone exams.
Keystone Review
Students who have not scored proficient or higher on a Keystone Exam may be enrolled in a Keystone Review course, as required by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. Keystone Review courses are basic, supplemental courses structured to help students reach on-level standards. High school students may not opt-out of a Keystone Review course.
L
Learning Management System (LMS)
The broad term for the technical system that runs school websites. PALCS refers to our LMS as PALCSchool, and is, in fact, a combination and customization of other LMSes that other cyber schools commonly use, including Moodle and Canvas.
Lessons
Lessons are created personally by PALCS teachers and are how we deliver instruction to students. Each PALCS lesson is like its own website presenting information about a subject. Lessons might be text written by the teacher or imported from textbooks or other websites, they might have audio or video components, or might be interactive websites or educational games. Lessons are followed by assignments to check student progress. Each lesson is posted about a week in advance of the assignment’s due date.
Lesson Help
Specifically posted times that teachers will be available live in a virtual classroom during the day for extra support. Sometimes interchangeably called Office Hours. While similar to a Virtual Lesson because they both take place with your teacher in a virtual classroom at a certain time, your teachers will cover a prepared, specific topic in a Virtual Lesson, while Lesson Help is open-ended and can be customized to a student’s specific needs.
M
MAP Test
MAP Testing is a diagnostic assessment tool used to see how students are progressing through their studies. We use the Northwest Evaluation Association (NWEA) for MAP testing, which helps us us adjust the pace and difficulty of lessons presented to students.
Materials
Items families receive from PALCS to facilitate learning. Students receive a computer (laptop by default), a printer/copier/scanner, and a microphone headset. Students also receive textbooks, novels, manipulatives, kits, or other items based on the courses the students are enrolled in. Each course has different materials, most of which will be returned at the end of each school year, though computer items and some clearly marked school materials may be kept from year to year based on enrollment.
Marking Periods
PALCS is divided into four marking periods, generally around late fall, mid-winter, spring, and the end of the school year. Students receive grades for each marking period, which will show up on a report card.
Middle School
PALCS middle school covers grades 6-8.  More information about courses and curriculum is on our 
Academics page.
Moodle
Modular Object-Oriented Dynamic Learning Environment: a portion of the PALCSchool Learning Management System. Behind-the-scenes, when students log into PALCSchool every day, they are going through a Moodle doorway to count attendance, view daily announcements, and pass through to access courses and lessons. Moodle formerly supported all courses for our school, instead of the portion it does now, so we may still occasionally refer to our school website, PALCSchool, as Moodle.
N
NCAA
National Collegiate Athletic Association: an organization that establishes rules for eligibility, recruitment and scholarships for Division I and II sports at the college level. Most PALCS courses are NCAA-approved, and more information can be found on the 
NCAA eligibility website
.
Non-Academic Courses
In addition to core courses and elective courses, PALCS students may receive Non-Academic Courses. No grades or credit are assigned for these courses, but they are helpful resources for PALCS families. Examples include the guidance course, homeroom, bridge to student success, and student government.
O
Office Hours
PALCS staff members work in-office during normal business hours, generally Monday – Friday, 8 am to 4 pm, though there is some level of flexibility. Families may always reach out to us during these times. The term Office Hours may also be interchangeably used with Lesson Help, which are specifically posted times teachers will be available live in a virtual classroom during the day for extra support.
Orientation
As the final part of the PALCS enrollment process, after submitting a registration packet, families interested in enrolling in PALCS will attend an Orientation. Families learn about the school website, cover school policies, receive materials, and become students either on the day of — or shortly after — the orientation.
P
PA Department of Education (PDE)
The governing body of all schools in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The PDE granted PALCS its charter to operate, and we are fully accountable to their standards and oversight.
PALCS

Parent Responsibilities tab of the Handbook page
.
Parent Advisory Board
Board of PALCS parents who meet with the principal monthly to provide feedback and school improvement suggestions.
Progress Check
About every three weeks, PALCS has a progress check. All lessons are to be completed by these progress check dates, and students will have an up-to-date grade in their course. Every third progress check is the end of a marking period, where grades will be recorded on student report cards.
PSSA
The Pennsylvania System of School Assessment, PALCS students in grades 3-8 are required to complete this state-mandated standardized testing in Language Arts and Math. Testing locations will be set up throughout the state on pre-appointed dates and proctored by PALCS teachers. Parents are required to make sure students attend and complete the PSSA.

Response to Instruction and Intervention (RtII)
PALCS offers courses in math and reading to help students build the skills they need to be successful on Keystone Exams and in high school courses. The Reading for Success and Math for Success courses are designed to provide students with individualized instruction and targeted interventions in Math and/or Reading. Students may be assigned to one of these courses based on assessment data, classroom performance and teacher input. The course is a requirement and will be taught by PALCS staff in a synchronous format. The course is worth 0.5 of an elective credit which can count toward a student’s general elective graduation requirement.
S
School Board Meetings
Board meetings are held every other month. These meetings are open to the public. Learn more about 
School Board Meetings and Board Members.
Socialization
For the most part, PALCS students will be completing school work at home online, which is obviously a change from a traditional brick-and-mortar classroom. PALCS offers online open chats for students to talk to their peers, online activities and clubs, and many optional monthly field trips and activities so students can meet up. Students can obviously still see any local friends and families may still participate in sports and extra-curricular activities at their local district.

Testing
PALCS students complete several kinds of tests: standardized testing, like the PSSA and Keystone Exams, and also online assignments and tests to check student progress.

In addition to the asynchronous learning students complete for most schoolwork at PALCS, students have access to live virtual lessons that take place at set times. Students can talk to their teachers and other students in the class while the teacher covers a lesson in real-time. Virtual lessons last about an hour and each course in the school has a virtual lesson. Some virtual lessons have required attendance, so students may be expected to be online live for some number of set hours each week. Some virtual lessons are optional, but recorded for later viewing.
