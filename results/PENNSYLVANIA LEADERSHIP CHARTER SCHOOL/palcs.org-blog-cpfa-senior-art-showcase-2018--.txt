CPFA Senior Art Showcase 2018
April 12, 2018 marked the opening of the 2018 CPFA Senior Art Exhibition. This annual exhibit celebrates and displays the work of 15 remarkable Center for Performing and Fine Arts students from the Class of 2018.
This year’s exhibition will run from April 12 – May 25 in the Commonwealth Room of the main PALCS office, located in West Chester, PA. The exhibit will showcase works created in CPFA painting & drawing, ceramics, sculpture, graphic design, and photography classes. 
The Center for Performing and Fine Arts and the entire PA Leadership Charter School is incredibly proud to present our high school seniors and their final high school exhibition: Tirzah Badders, Chantel Brannon, Charlotte Briskin, Stevie Burton, Phoebe Caswell, Julianna Chen, Julianne DiIorio, Tanya Patton, Morgan Ramoth, Elijah Rottman, Grace Slear, Anna Stewart, Jenna Suchower, John Viggiano, and Julie White.
The 2018 Senior Art Exhibition truly encompasses what makes the fine arts program at CPFA exceptional.  Several of the students whose work is on display have been committed to the fine arts classes at CPFA for 7 years.  
These 15 students prepared for this self-driven show by researching well known artists and concepts, perfecting techniques, and writing reflections. Following intensive portfolio preparation for acceptance into some of the country’s finest and most competitive colleges, students are given the opportunity to create art to exhibit in a professional manner.
We are sincerely proud of these extraordinary students, for their work reflects a deep understanding of what it means to be an artist, which is rare to realize at such a young age. Congratulations!
