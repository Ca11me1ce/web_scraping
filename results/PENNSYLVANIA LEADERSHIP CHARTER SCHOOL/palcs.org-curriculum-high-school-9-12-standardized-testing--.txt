State Standardized Testing
As PALCS is a public school in Pennsylvania, PALCS students participate in state-mandated standardized tests: the 
Pennsylvania System of School Assessment
 (PSSA) and the 
Keystone Exams
.
PSSAs: Taken by every student in grades 3 through 8 in language arts and math. Students in grades 4 and 8 are additionally tested in science.
Keystones: Taken by students after they have completed English Literature, Algebra 1 and Biology courses, usually in early high school grades. Completion of the Keystone Exams is also part of the graduation requirements at PALCS.
Though PALCS is a cyber school, state standardized testing will take place in-person at various locations around the state, proctored by PALCS teachers and staff. Attendance and participation at in-person state assessments is mandatory, and parents should plan transportation for students, allotting time for test completion.
PALCS is the best-performing cyber charter school serving all grades K-12 in Pennsylvania. Complete PSSA information can be found directly on the PA Department of Education website, 
PASchoolPerformance.org
. We are listed as “Pennsylvania Leadership CS” on the Charter/Cyber Charter tab.
Course Grading and Testing
Courses
PALCS students complete all their regular day-to-day schoolwork online. After students receive instruction from their teachers, local assessments such as course-level quarterly exams, quizzes, and unit tests are completed much like in a brick-and-mortar school, though they are completed on computer through our school website. Tests and quizzes, combined with writing, projects, media submissions, online discussions, live participation, and more factor together to create the course grades for PALCS students.

MAP Testing
As part of our language arts and math courses, PALCS students periodically participate in online Measure of Academic Progress (MAP) testing to check that students are comprehending and progressing through their instructional school year. This adaptive test allows students to complete open-ended questions to the best of their ability. In turn, the data from MAP testing helps PALCS teachers correctly tier students into course difficulty levels, so we can support or challenge our students as necessary into on-level, academic, college-prep, and advanced/honors/AP courses.
