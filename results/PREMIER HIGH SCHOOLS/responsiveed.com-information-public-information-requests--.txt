Public Information Requests
State public information acts provide a mechanism for citizens to inspect or copy government records.  They also provide for instances in which governmental bodies may, or are required by law to, withhold government records from the public.
All requests for public information should be submitted to the Responsive Education Solutions® (“ResponsiveEd”) Administrative Offices.  This procedure allows ResponsiveEd® to accurately document the date each request is received and respond to the requestor in accordance with applicable state law.
Tips for Successful Public Information Requests
The following tips will help ensure that you receive the information you want:
Submit your request in writing.
Include enough description and detail about the information requested so that we may accurately identify and locate the requested information.
Include your name and phone number so that we may contact you if we have questions about how to respond to your request.
Include your address (electronic and mailing) so that we may send you a response.
