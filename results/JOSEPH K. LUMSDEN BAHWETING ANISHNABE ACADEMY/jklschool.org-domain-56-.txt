Mrs. Tracey Knight
Tracey has been teaching at JKL Bahweting School since 2002.  As a third grade teacher, Tracey is passionate about getting to know her students and helping them to become active participants in their own learning.  Tracey believes that students learn best when they are comfortable with their teachers and themselves as learners, and she works hard to help them develop a growth mindset that will be beneficial throughout their lives.  She teaches children to embrace their mistakes and truly own them because that is where the magic of learning happens. Tracey lives in Sault Ste. Marie with her husband, Jim.  She enjoys reading, camping, jeeping and spending time with friends and family, which includes her two adult children Max and Erin.
