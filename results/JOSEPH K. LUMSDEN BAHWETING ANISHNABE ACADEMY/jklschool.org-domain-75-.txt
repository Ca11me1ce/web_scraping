JKL Bahweting School PSA
Below are the permission forms for parents to sign so that their students can have access to Google Apps for Education in JKL Bahweting School (JKL).  Here are some answers to frequently asked questions: 
Why use Google Apps for Education?
•    To provide students with access to current technology applications and free tools designed for collaboration with other students and teachers
•    To give students the ability to work on their documents both in school and at home - anytime and anywhere from any Internet connected device
•    To help students work collaboratively, engage in peer-editing of documents, and publish for a wider audience within JKL Bahweting School
•    To facilitate “paperless” transfer of work between students and teachers
•    To provide adequate (thirty gigabytes) long-term storage space for student work
•    A potential cost savings in terms of software licensing and document storage
How are JKL Bahweting School and Google linked together?
The Google agreement with the JKL Bahweting School provides access to Google applications and storage. While Google hosts these services off-site, the District maintains the ability to manage users, groups, and settings, much like other locally hosted systems.  This means that JKL can grant and remove user access, and control other settings to ensure a safe and secure collaboration environment for students and teachers.  
What personal student information and student education records will be stored in Google Apps for Education?
The terms of the Google contract with the JKL Bahweting School mandate that we must have parental permission for the use of Google Apps for Education.  On the Google permission form that parents are asked to sign, it states that "information about my child will be collected and stored electronically."  Google does not request any personal information from students and the District does not provide personal student data (ex. birthdate, address, phone number, grades, test scores) to Google.  That information resides in the JKL student information system (NASIS) and is neither stored nor available to Google.  
The permission form also states that “my student's education records stored in Google Apps for Education may be accessible to someone other than my student and JKL Bahweting School".  Examples of student education records in Google are assignments, notes, calendars and projects created by the student.  
How are students identified in Google Apps for Education?
Students will log in using the following pattern:
username@students.jklschool.org
Username = first 2 letters of first name + first 5 letters of last name + 2 digit graduation year.
