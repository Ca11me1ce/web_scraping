School Performance
In 2016, Summit High School was proudly awarded a 20-year charter renewal by the Arizona State Board for Charter Schools, alongside 14 other Leona Group schools. This came as a result of an extensive review of all school performance systems and structures, which included curriculum, instruction, assessment, professional development, and student achievement among others and shows are commitment to providing a quality education for all of our students.
Summit High School is accredited by AdvancEd, an independent organization that reviews educational systems and institutions. The accreditation process consists of a thorough review, evaluation and graded report of the school's mission, performance goals, courses, teacher instruction, administrative procedures, and achievement data, to name a few areas, by an AdvancEd team of educators.
To students and parents, accreditation means that student transcripts and grades are accepted by colleges throughout the country.
