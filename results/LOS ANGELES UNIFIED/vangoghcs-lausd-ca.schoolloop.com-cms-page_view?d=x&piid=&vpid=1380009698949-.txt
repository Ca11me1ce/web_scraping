A HUGE THANK YOU !
Van Gogh expresses a HUGE THANKS to:
The Patriot Oil Community Benefit Trust Fund for 
 their continued support  for our computer lab an our technological needs.
The Granada Hills North Neighborhood Council for their generous contribution for library books and physical education equipment!
Councilman Mitch Englander's office for his generous contribution to our school.  Funds will support our students in a variety of ways.
Calling All Volunteers!!!
Our school needs YOUR HELP! Volunteers are needed for our MORNING DROP-OFF VALET.  Student safety is a priority, and the more support we have, the safer our students will be.  Please see the main office to help.
LOST AND FOUND
Please label your student's jackets, backpacks, and lunch boxes with their name.  This will help ensure that lost items may be found.  Our collection of unclaimed items grows rapidly and is donated to charity at the end of each month.
Peanut Policy
Please support us......Due to students with severe peanut allergies, we request that snacks and lunches stay PEANUT FREE! 
We would appreciate your support in avoiding sending foods that contain peanuts or any other form of tree nuts, such as sandwich crackers filled with peanut butter, granola bars, and trail mix.
Some healthy & nutritional 
alternatives
 include: ham, roast beef, tuna, egg salad, cream cheese and jelly sandwiches, hard-boiled eggs, fruit salad, yogurt & fruit, fruit rollups, apples with caramel, hummus, celery & carrot sticks, animal crackers, popcorn, pudding or Jell-o, and Rice Krispie Treats. Thank you for your cooperation!
