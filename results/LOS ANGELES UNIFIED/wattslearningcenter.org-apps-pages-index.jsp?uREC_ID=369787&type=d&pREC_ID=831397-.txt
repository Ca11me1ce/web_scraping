WLC Families,
Any report of violence in schools is hard to understand.  Especially for children.
Our hearts go out to all the students, staff, and community members affected by the recent tragedy at North Park Elementary School. 
Watts Learning Center Schools will continue to provide a safe environment for our students, staff, and parents. And in so doing, our schools will continue to conduct regular safety drills to ensure that our students and staff are familiar with safety procedures during an emergency.
We also want to provide our teachers and families with tools and resources to help facilitate conversations after a school shooting and gage or manage student distress.
Below, please find a list of links and articles that are well-vetted and designed to assist parents and educators in moments like these.
There is no excuse for violence on a school campus.  And Watts Learning Center Schools will continue to make student and staff safety our top priority above all else.

Director's Message
“Be the change you wish to see in the world.”-Gandhi
Welcome to the Watts Learning Center!
The Watts Learning Center is a temple of learning, where students, teachers, parents, and staff maintain high expectations which encourage children to grow into productive citizens with a passion for lifelong learning. It is truly my honor to serve the children and community of the Watts Learning Center.
We have a rigorous academic program that prepares students for the 21st century with a world-class education. Our hands-on, standards-based curriculum provides students with an integrated approach to learning with literacy as the foundation.
In addition to a strong focus on the core curriculum, students must also acquire the skills necessary to become collaborative workers, effective communicators, community contributors, and complex thinkers. We believe in setting high expectations and providing children with a nurturing, safe, and supportive learning environment.
The success of our school community depends upon the collaboration, commitment, and involvement of parents, students, teachers, and community members. We know that our families are an essential part of our school community, as they are our children’s first teachers. We believe they are our most valuable resource in helping our students to succeed. We know that collaborative decision making with strong staff and parent involvement make our school a dynamic place to learn and work.
We have embraced the African proverb that, “It takes a village to raise a child.”
We welcome you all into our village.
Sincerely,
Mrs. Kelly Baptiste, Director
