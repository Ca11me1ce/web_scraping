Transitional Kindergarten/Kindergarten Program
The New Heights Charter School Transitional Kindergarten program will be phased in over three years and be fully implemented by 2014.
In 2013-14, children who have their fifth birthday between October 2 and December 2 will be admitted to the Transitional Kindergarten program.
In 2014-15 and each school year thereafter, children who have their fifth birthday between September 2 and December 2 will be admitted to the Transitional Kindergarten program.
The Transitional Kindergarten program at New Heights is designed for children with birthdays between October 1 and December 2, as well as kindergarten-age children who need a more developmental approach to learning.
The transitional kinder/kinder classroom provides students with the following:
a lively and developmentally appropriate 
classroom environment
;
academic and socio-emotional support for young learners;
small group activities and 
differentiated instruction
;
blended kindergarten content standards, preschool foundations, and developmental extended opportunities for language, literacy, and development of math concepts through songs, play, games, and other engaging activities;
culturally responsive and relevant
 content; and
ongoing, intentional and purposeful parent, family and community engagement.
