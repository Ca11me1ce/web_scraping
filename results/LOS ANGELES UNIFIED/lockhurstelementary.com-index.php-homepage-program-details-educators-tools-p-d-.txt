Computerwisekids follows the ISTE standards of Technology Education. We train and educate teachers how to use technology tools and integrate technology in their classrooms.  There are many invaluable resources available for students.  However, our research has found it is tough for the classroom teacher to integrate the curriculum with technology due to the lack of computer training, technical support, budget and time.  Computerwisekids helps give their expert knowledge and technical support to the teacher and classroom.  This system creates knowledge transfer for sustainable teaching.
