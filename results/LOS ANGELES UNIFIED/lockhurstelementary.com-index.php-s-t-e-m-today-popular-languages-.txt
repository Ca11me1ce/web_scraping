These days, children are growing up in a new era of technology. From smartphones to iPads, children have more power at their fingertips than ever before, making it a truly exciting time in our society. In recent years, the importance of programming has become a subject of increasing awareness. Ever since former President Obama endorsed mandatory computer programming education in schools across the country, students all over the country are becoming more and more interested in computer programming and coding. This is also likely due to the fact that there is a tremendous demand in the job marketing for occupations in the Math, Science, Engineering, and Technology realm.
While it’s one thing to know how to use these incredible technologies, it’s another to understand the brilliant logic behind them. When children have an opportunity to learn how to program, it opens them up for endless possibilities in the job market.

In this blog, we’re going to take a look at some popular programming languages for kids.
Computer Language #1: Python
Python is a great computer language for children because it reads like normal speech. This kind of code will give your child an understanding of how to think like a programmer, and with Python, students have very few obstacles when it comes to learning the program.
When you enroll your child in a Python programming classes, they will learn how to construct their own programming ideas before they focus on transferring these ideas into a language that the machine can interpret. Python is also known as a “batteries included” language, which means that many of the common functionalities are already programmed into the programming language, making it easier for young children to learn.
Computer Language #2: Ruby
Does your child like shiny objects? Then, they’ll love learning Ruby! Sorry, that was a bad joke, but all jokes aside, Ruby is a great beginner language for kids. Ruby can be very self-explanatory, which is great for children who are still learning the basic concepts of programming. Ruby was originally used to create Twitter, and offers a robust language and a very readable syntax for beginner programmers.
Computer Language #3: Java
Java can be a little more difficult to learn than Ruby and Python, and may be a great computer language to teach a more advanced student. If your child starts off learning Java, they will be in a great position, and it will make learning other subsequent languages even easier to absorb. When most people think of Java, they think of creating their own apps or websites, but that’s only half the fun of this exciting computer language.
Computer Language #4: C++
Another more challenging computer language for children is C++. While some computer science professionals and developers have differing opinions on the value of learning this language, it can open up many doors in the programming world. This programming language can look a lot like math, but many of today’s most successful programmers started their careers by learning C++.
