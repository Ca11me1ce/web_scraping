Curriculum    
Curriculum Overview 
The New Heights curriculum is based on educational research on how children learn best.
English Language Arts 
The curriculum focuses on reading fluency, comprehension, writing, and speaking.  Teachers usa a balanced approach to literacy that is based on teaching students the skills that good teaders and writers use.  In all grade levels, students write and read every day in Writer's and Reader's Workshop.  To support decoding and fluency, teachers in lower grades use Systematic Instruction in Phonics Awareness and Sight Words (SIPPS). To support comprehension teachers use Calkins' Reading and Writing Units of Study, Making Meaning, Text Talk, and the Comprehension Toolkit.
Mathematics
New Heights’ teachers use the Common Core Math to help students develop a deep understanding of mathematical concepts and build math fluency.  Students learn why math works in order to master complex problem-solving.
Social Studies
Teachers use active instructional strategies with Social Studies and History Alive. Students work in cooperative groups to learn progressively more difficult concepts through a process of discovery.
Science
New Heights uses GEMS (K), Full Option Science System (1st Grade) Seeds of Science/Roots of Reading (2nd-5th Grade) and It's About Time (for 6th - 8th Grade) to support an interactive research-based approach to science.  The science program provides active engagement for students.  The programs feature core content integrated with scientific thinking processes and literacy.
Caring Community
New Heights uses Responsive Classroom (TK-5) and Developmental Design (6-8) strategies to build positive relationships, help students bond to the values of the school, and build effective classroom learning environments. Teachers also work with caring community approaches to engage parents, and allow younger and older students to engage in cross-age buddy activities.
