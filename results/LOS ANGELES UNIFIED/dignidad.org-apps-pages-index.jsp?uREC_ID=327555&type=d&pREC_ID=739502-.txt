Afterschool Program
Semillas partners with the Youth Policy Institute to provide comprehensive after-school services for our elementary school students.
21st Century Kids and Rock On Education strive to create a generation of leaders by empowering youth, engaging parents and community, and enriching school culture.
YPI’s afterschool program reaches more than 4,000 students every day at 39 school sites. Partnering with the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) and charter schools in Los Angeles, 21st Century Kids (elementary and middle programs) and Rock On Education (high school programs) offer tutoring and project-based activities that increase academic achievement while keeping learning fun. The afterschool program provides students and their families with credentialed teachers and college-age tutors every school day until 6 pm. 
 The program provides both academic assistance and enrichment activities that work to keep students on track for timely grade level promotion and graduation from high school. 21st Century Kids and Rock On Education offer tutoring, parenting workshops, financial literacy, test preparation and other services for all grade levels to support families in meeting the goal of a college education. To complement this, at the high school level Rock On Education offers career preparation services, including career exploration, job skills training, job shadowing with mentors in the community, and coursework for specific career tracks in partnership with LAUSD and local community colleges.
