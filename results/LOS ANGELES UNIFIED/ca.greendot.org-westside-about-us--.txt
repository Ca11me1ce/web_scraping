About Ánimo Westside	
Ánimo Westside Charter Middle School is a charter middle school located in Los Angeles, California. It serves students in the community of Venice. Our charter was approved by the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) and the school currently has students enrolled in grades 6-8.
History	
Ánimo Westside Charter Middle School was opened in 2011 to provide the Venice community with a high quality alternative to underperforming district schools and boost the achievement levels of students entering local high schools, including Ánimo Venice. With just a sixth grade enrolled in 2011-12, the school achieved an API score of 817, well above local and state norms. The school is perhaps the most demographically diverse within the Green Dot network, hinting at a return to public education by the middle class after decades of ‘white flight’ to parochial and private schools. Green Dot expects the successes at Westside to continue and the effects to be felt at Ánimo Venice in the coming years.
