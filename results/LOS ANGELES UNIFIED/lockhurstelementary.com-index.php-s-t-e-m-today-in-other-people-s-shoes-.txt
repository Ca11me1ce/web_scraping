Why Teach Coding?
Today our world sufferers from consumerism now even more than in the past. Our kids are used to being entertained constantly. We teach to consume vs. create and we need to change that and here's why.
Coding is a creative process of developing a program, application or game. The creator (your child) is involved in a series of analytical thinking processes that are complex. The process is complex because you have to think about the design, the user experience, the user interface and the final product.
Coding involves concepts of logic, sequencing, science and art. One programming stage that stands out making it particularly important in education is, "putting yourself in someone else's shoes". I'm sure you have asked your child to see the other persons point of view. As the architect of the program, they need to constantly think of the other persons experience as a user. A coding curriculum addresses just that. In writing class or art class our students connect to share their world, but they are rarely forced to make the viewers experience a number 1 priority. Put someone else's needs before yours, and think about what they may need or want; a simple, beautiful lesson I discovered by accident while teaching code.
At the end of the coding lesson my students learned to take strong constructive criticism objectively. They learned resilience and grit as we debugged the programs. And, most of all I am positive, I'll be sending out kids who can see more than one point of view or one way of doing things.
