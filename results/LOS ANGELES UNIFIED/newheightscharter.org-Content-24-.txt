School Vision    
THE HEART OF THE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM AT NEW HEIGHTS CHARTER SCHOOL is our nurture of the academic, social, emotional and physical development of each child.  Our approach to teaching and learning encourages student initiative and ownership, promotes inquiry, foster dialogues, generates awareness of healthy choices, expands and strengthens thinking processes, and develops
 basic skills in reading, writing, mathematics, speaking and listening.
New Heights Charter School promotes rigorous academic learning in a safe, caring school environment.  Students are challenged and supported to meet common core standards using an instructional framework that places emphasis on student understanding.
The beginning years, transitional kinder/kinder through second grade, of our program allow for students to successfully enter the world of school, developing their foundational skills in reading, math, science, social studies, physical education, and the arts within an environment that cultivates their social/emotional growth . From third to fifth grades, students are given increased responsibilities, long range projects, and problem-solving opportunities in a safe and caring atmosphere. During their three years in the middle grades, sixth through eighth, students have important opportunities for increased freedom and greater personal responsibility.  Within a tightly structured schedule, faculty work diligently to instill in students self-confidence, responsibility, and ownership of their educational life.
