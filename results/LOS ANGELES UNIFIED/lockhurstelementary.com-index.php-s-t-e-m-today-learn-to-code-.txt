STEM is a new buzzword in the educational field that stands for the study of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, 15 of the 20 fastest growing jobs require skills in these areas, and educators are encouraging children of all ages to get involved in STEM education classes.
At Computerwisekids.com, we’re passionate about preparing future generations for jobs in the science, mathematics, technology, and engineering fields. That’s why we’ve dedicated ourselves to offering state-of-the-art STEM and coding classes for children of all ages in California. We offer

Why Should My Child Learn To Code?
The primary push for students to learn to code is centered around preparing them for future jobs. There is a significant skill shortage in the computer science industry, and enrolling your little one in a coding or programming class can teach them a number of valuable life lessons, such as:
The importance of learning from mistakes.
Teamwork is critical to any success.
The significance of problem solving in the workplace.
If we change our perspective a bit and think about code as its own unique language, it’s easy to say that code is one of the most used languages in the United States, and even in the world. As the globe continues to move towards an era where programming and software will take up most of the jobs available, coding essentially becomes the new, worldwide language.
Coding Can Help Your Child Build Problem Solving Skills
Does your child run to you when they have a problem? Does your little one struggle to find their own solutions every day? If you’re looking for a way to encourage individual problem solving in your child, enrolling them in a coding class may be beneficial.
Unlike your typical school class, computational thinking teaches students to break down their large problems into small, achievable steps. Teaching your child this skill is virtually priceless, as it will help your child in an array of other areas down the line. When your child learns how to write code, they will learn how to make and accept their mistakes, while also looking for creative ways to solve problems. Computer programming is a unique field that allows you to test solutions immediately, so your child will quickly learn that making mistakes is normal, and testing new solutions can be fun.
Encourage Creativity With A Coding Class
If your little one struggles to find their voice in a standard educational setting, a coding class is a great way to get them out of their comfort zone. Coding classes encourage children to be creative, and when your child’s creativity is met with a tool that offers unlimited potential, there’s no telling what sparks will fly!
At Computerwisekids in Woodland Hills, we’re proud to offer a wonderful selection of coding classes for children of all ages and skill levels. Whether you’re looking for a basic typing class to teach your child the computer keyboard, or you’d like to enroll your child in a 3D print and design class or a robotics class, we’ve got the perfect class for your little one.

A Coding Class Can Help Your Child With Academics
Did you know that enrolling your child in a coding class or summer camp will help to improve his or her understanding in subjects like physics, geometry, algebra, and arithmetic? In even more advanced coding classes, your child will be introduced to trigonometry and even calculus concepts. Coding has also been found to strengthen a student’s reading and spelling abilities as well.
According to Bill Gates, one of the principal founders of the Microsoft Corporation, "Learning to write programs stretches your mind and helps you think better. It creates a way of thinking about things that I think is helpful in all domains."
Coding Teaches Collaboration & Teamwork
If you have an only child at home, you may be looking for a way to encourage them to make friends and collaborate with others. While it may be hard to believe, one of the most overlooked aspects of coding is the amount of teamwork that goes into the creation of a single piece of software. Whether your child is working on creating a game or app, it is very rare that one person will code everything.
During virtually any coding project, your child will have to regularly communicate with their teammates to make sure everyone is working towards the same goal. For example, if your child is working on a robot with a group of kids, they may be responsible for one moving part, such as the left leg.
