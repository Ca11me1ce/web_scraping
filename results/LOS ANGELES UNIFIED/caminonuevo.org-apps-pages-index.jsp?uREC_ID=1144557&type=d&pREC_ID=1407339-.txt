Ethnic Studies For All
Ethnic Studies For All Curriculum Showcase
At our first Ethnic Studies Showcase last week, we were thrilled to come together and celebrate the work of our cross-campus Ethnic Studies task force. About 14 Camino Nuevo teachers presented model units and lesson plans and shared how an ethnic studies curriculum could be implemented across grades and disciplines at all our schools. Alma Osuna, who teaches kindergarten, said ethnic studies allowed her to connect learning to her students’ identities, which increased student invesment. Haidi Quintanilla, who teaches fifth grade, said her lessons taught her students to think more critically about what they read. In her ethnic studies unit, “Rethinking Dr. Seuss,” students analyzed the author’s books and learned that “racism can hide anywhere, even in a kid’s book,” after finding harmful stereotypes about black and Asian people in them. 
Extending an invitation for more teachers to join the initiative, Camino Nuevo CEO Ana Ponce said, “This is a gift that will stay with all of our kids... It matters that we teach our students how beautiful and wonderful their backgrounds and their stories are so that they know who they are.” Thank you to everyone who came to support our work. If you are interested in getting involved, please contact ethnic studies teacher Ron Espiritu, ron.espiritu@camino.nuevo.org
Teachers who join the initiave receive additional training and support to create empowering ethnic studies units and lesson plans. We're looking to grow from 40 participating teachers and leaders to 80 next year. Join us!
Visual Art in the Ethnic Studies Framework
When combined with the Ethnic Studies frameworks of critical reflection and analysis, art becomes a tool to challenge dominant narratives that marginalize and negate non-dominant identities.
