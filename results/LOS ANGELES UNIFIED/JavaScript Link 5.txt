News & Announcements
								Threat against school a hoax according to LAPD							
								A school threat received by school administration turned out to be a hoax.							
								UCLA Students Remember Hunger Strike for Xicana/o Studies							
								The Hunger Strikes of 1993 are part of a legacy of Chicanx student resistance, one that secured spaces for Raza to be included. Many times this institutional and historical memory leaves us; for the dignity and respect of our Elders who participated in this time of tension, we mustn’t forget. As a community struggle, Raza students took it in their own means to propose what sustaining Xicana/o Studies would look like. It was a time where Chicana/o Studies stood at the edge of being cut completely, as well as its resources on the UCLA campus. The spirit and dedication for direct action was needed to put pressure on administration, to remind the university that they serve us -- the people.							
								UCLA Recognizes 1993 Student Hunger Strike							
								"As the 25th anniversary of the hunger strike approaches, 200 students are enrolled in the major and 300 in the minor. Perhaps most impressive, more than 30 are pursuing Ph.D.s. These students, the academic leaders of the future, are a powerful sign of success for a department that nearly disappeared." Thousands more have taken classes over the last quarter century. The power of this movement was in our five-year process as undergraduate students of reframing Chicana/o Studies as a search for, and affirmation of, native knowledge as Indigenous Peoples - not Hispanics and not Latinos. This was a spiritually militant movement - connected to a community and guided by elders. Those who fasted and those who protested and those who were arrested in 1993 became catalysts for the foundations we had established exhausting all bureaucratic barriers Chuck Young and his cabal placed before our community and the decades of movement before that. However, we did not defend what existed (the NACS sanctioned version of ivory tower scholarly minutia) - we sowed and defended a vision of what Chicana/o Studies COULD BECOME...a center of community-based millenarian Indigenous scholarship.							
								Racially and culturally insensitive and incompetent educators continue to be a problem for Native American students							
								IT'S PAST TIME FOR A CHANGE...American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) graduation rates have been on a downward trend since 2008 and analysis of the socio-economic reasons driving it is ongoing. As The Nation recently found, “Punitive discipline, inadequate curriculum, and declining federal funding created an education crisis.” CALIFORNIA IS NO EXCEPTION! IN CALIFORNIA PUSH OUT RATES FOR AMERICAN INDIAN STUDENTS ARE OVER TWICE AS HIGH AS ALL WHITE DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS.							
								NEW YORK TIMES TODAY: Indian Slavery Once Thrived in New Mexico. Latinos Are Finding Family Ties to It.							
								Pointing to their history, some descendants of Genízaros are coming together to argue that they deserve the same recognition as Native tribes in the United States. One such group in Colorado, the 200-member Genízaro Affiliated Nations, organizes annual dances to commemorate their heritage.							
								Semillas partners with After-School All-Stars							
								Semillas Community Schools is happy to announce our partnership with After-School All-Stars, Los Angeles on the 21st Century application.  If successful, this award will allow us to provide our students with a comprehensive after-school program at: Anahuacalmecac International University Preparatory of North America K-12 a State Board of Education authorized, autonomous, public, community-based charter school.							
								Anahuacalmecac Highlighted at IB World Conference							
								Anahuacalmecac World School featured in IB World magazine Special Issue: “Semillas instigated a revolution in LA.”							
								NATIONAL REPORT released TODAY by National Urban Indian Family Coalition highlights Anahuacalmecac							
								The National Urban Indian Family Coalition (NUIFC) http://nuifc.org/ HAS RELEASED a national paper on Urban Indian Education including Anahuacalmecac World School.							
								Anahuacalmecac Highlighted in National Webinar: Expanding Opportunities to Learn for Native Youth							
								The NUIFC is releasing a national paper on Urban Indian Education written by Dr. Joe Hobot and this webinar is kicking it off! If you can't make it, it will be on Youtube after it airs on Thursday. Please join us as we celebrate and recognize indigenous educational resistance across the continent. Anahuacalmecac World School Semillas Community Schools has been highlighted in this upcoming report on education and Native Americans/Indigenous Peoples in the US. Thank you Janeen Comenote and Chrissie Castro !!  PLEASE NOTE: 11AM PST (2PM EST)							
								Congrats Anahuacalmecac: Today is Indigenous Peoples Day in LA!							
								On Monday, as people across the country celebrated the controversial Columbus Day holiday, young Native Americans in Los Angeles marked Indigenous Peoples Day for the first time in their city.							
								Anahuacalmecac to join Indigenous Peoples Day Celebration at UCLA							
								The elimination of Columbus Day and the establishment of Indigenous Peoples Day in its place on the second Monday of October represents a huge victory for indigenous people and for everyone in Los Angeles. Please join us for a gathering to honor the work of the city representatives and community coalition that made this historic victory possible. Danza Azteca Anahuacalmecac will present.							
								Anahuacalmecac convenes first Los Angeles Area IB World Community Leadership Collaborative							
								IB World Schools seek collaboration							
								Tenth Anniversary of the adoption of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP)							
								The University of Colorado Law School and the Secretariat of the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (SPFII) are hosting a two-day event on 13-14 September, 2017, to commemorate the Tenth Anniversary of the adoption of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP).
