Student Spotlight
Book Fair Volunteers
Mrs. Starks and I, would like to thank all of the student volunteers who helped make the book fair such a great success! We were both very impressed with the volunteers' enthusiasm and eagerness to work. We could not have run the book fair without them. Volunteer duties ranged from helping customers shop, straightening books, checking inventory, setting up for special events, and much more. 
Thanks again to all the volunteers. We truly appreciate your hard work!
-Ms. Szaflarski
