												School Culture									
																		Mission
Lafayette Academy prepares its students for success in a college preparatory high school in an atmosphere that challenges and supports each student to achieve his or her highest potential.
Values
Lafayette’s values are at the core of the school culture and serve as the guiding principles of our behavior management approach. 
Respect
We respect ourselves.
We respect others.
We respect our teachers and our school.
Responsibility
We take responsibility for our education.
We take responsibility for our actions.
We take responsibility for our school.
Reach
We reach for excellence.
We reach beyond ourselves.
We reach to make the world a better place.
Positive Discipline: Lafayette’s teachers provide positive reinforcement both informally in the classroom and through the Super Ticket program. Students earn tickets from teachers and administrators for academic effort, demonstration of positive character and weekly attendance. Tickets are exchanged for prizes at the Super Store. 
A full description of expectations for student behavior and consequences of misbehavior may be found in the Student and Parent Handbook. A brief summary follows:
