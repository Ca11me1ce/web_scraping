“I decided to invest in Capital City not simply for the students who are fortunate enough to attend this school, but because it is a model that can be replicated in other schools to help students throughout our city.”
— Rob Falk, Former Capital City Board Member

Specific Ways to Show Your Support:
Annual Fund
	The Annual Fund is our primary fundraising campaign. Gifts are received from parents (
Family & Friends Giving Fund
), staff, board, foundations, organizations, and others in the community between July 1 – June 30. These funds help to support resources that include providing our students with challenging learning expeditions and intellectually engaging fieldwork, high-quality arts instruction, free after-school sports and extracurricular activities, and intensive and ongoing professional development for our dedicated teachers.
Pledges
	Pledge payments can be made monthly or quarterly any time between July 1 – June 30. Monthly recurring donations can be charged to your credit/debit card through our secure, online donation site.
Combined Federal Campaign, #26009
	You can donate to Capital City PCS through the Combined Federal Campaign (CFC). Our CFC # is 26009.
Rewards Programs – Local Shopping
	Register your store cards to earn money for Capital City while you shop.  Your grocery store cards can earn extra cash for Capital City! See 
this link
 for how to register at various local and online stores (including 
smile.amazon.com
) and note that for many you must renew every year.  These programs earn Capital City hundreds of dollars each year.
Support the Parent School Association (PSA)
	You can directly support the work of our 
PSA
. 
Use this link
 and designate your donation to the PSA at the bottom of the donation page.
Stock Transfer
	Charitable contributions and transfers of stock are routinely wired electronically from a benefactor’s personal or professional bank account through an Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) to a Capital City PCS account. Contact us at 
development@ccpcs.org
 or 202.808.9748 for more information.
Planned Giving
	Donors can include a bequest to Capital City in one’s will or trust.  Such gifts often offset estate taxes and can be made in a specific amount, as a percentage of your estate, or as a residual portion of the estate. We also accept charitable gift annuities, charitable remainder trusts, gifts of real estate and gifts of life insurance.
Workplace Giving
	Donors can designate Capital City for automatic contributions through various workplace-giving campaigns such as the Combined Federal Campaign (CFC). In the meantime, ask your employer whether they participate in a workplace matching gift program.
In-kind Gifts
	By providing an in-kind donation, you have the opportunity to make a unique contribution that may be eligible for a tax deduction without a cash commitment. For more information about how you can make an in-kind donation, please contact our development office at 
development@ccpcs.org
 or 202.808.9748.
Thank you for your support of Capital City!
Capital City Expenses for the 2017-2018 School Year
Capital City is committed to transparent fiscal responsibility.
 The D.C. Public Charter School Board has commended Capital City year after year for its fiscal responsibility. The non-profit database GuideStar recommends to donors that an organization should spend no more than 24% of its budget on administrative costs; Capital City spends far less.
