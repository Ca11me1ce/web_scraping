“Being a scholar at Capital City makes you feel like you are part of a community that is always pushing you to go above and beyond.”

During the 2016-2017 school year, Capital City served over 980 students in PreK - 12th grade.  Our student body represents a wide range of ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds and students come from every zip code in the city.
