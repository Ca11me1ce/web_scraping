About
Our Model
“Capital City proves that a public school in the heart of D.C. can be successful, and the young people of our city deserve more opportunities like this.” 
— Anne Herr, Capital City Parent and Founder
Capital City is an award-winning 
public charter school
 in DC.
PARENT FOUNDED IN 2000
Founded in 2000 by a committed group of public school parents, we offer a rigorous 
academic program
 that emphasizes independent and collaborative learning within an inclusive community.
EL EDUCATION CREDENTIALED MENTOR SCHOOL
Through the 
EL Education
 model, students study compelling topics, many related to social justice, through authentic hands-on learning experiences that result in high quality and meaningful products.
WHOLE CHILD FOCUS
The school takes a whole child approach to education and offers exemplary programs in 
character education,
arts,
fitness/wellness,
 and 
adventure.
100% COLLEGE ACCEPTANCE
Since our first senior class, 100% of graduates have been 
accepted to college
. In a 2014 visit, First Lady Michelle Obama recognized the school for success in this area stating, “Here at Capital City, every student is college material, and the goal is to get the very best education possible.”
COMMITMENT TO DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION
The school serves a diverse population of nearly 1,000 
students 
(72% low-income; 50% Latino, 37% Black, 7% White, 2% Asian, 4% Multiracial). Capital City has been recognized as a model for diversity and inclusivity and makes a strong commitment to educational equity for all students.
