EL Education
“EL Education is a powerful and inclusive model and is, at its essence, how humans learn.”
— Mary Lord, Former Ward 2 Representative, D.C. State Board of Education
Capital City was founded as an 
EL Education
 (formerly Expeditionary Learning) school in 2000. Our innovative learning expeditions allow us to teach all subjects through the lens of a broader topic so students learn in the context of the community and the world in which they live. 
Watch this EL Education video that was filmed at Capital City
 to see a snapshot of the amazing learning experiences that happen here every day.
In 2015, after a collaborative effort in creating a portfolio showcasing our practices and results in three main areas: Mastery of Knowledge, Student Character and High Quality Work, Capital City was approved as an EL Education Credentialed School. View our
 Portfolio
 to learn more about how Capital City infuses the EL Education model in every aspect of the learning environment. Examine our 
gallery of high quality student work
, which will be constantly updated with current samples from our students.
Through learning expeditions, students engage in fieldwork, community service and work with experts, to complete in-depth studies in one or more subject areas. Expeditions culminate with projects and exhibitions that demonstrate mastery of standards. During their senior year of high school, students will design their own personal expedition to further an interest or passion. 
Learn more about our school year 2017-2018 PreK - 12 expeditions below.

They will create print and online resources to support and entertain these young immigrants. In order to meet this goal, students will read fiction about past and contemporary immigrants, texts such as The Jungle by Upton Sinclair, and the poetry of Langston Hughes. Fieldwork will include a walking tour of D.C.’s own “Harlem Renaissance” hot-spots and a trip to the National Mall to conduct interviews on perceptions of the American Dream. All of this will support students in the their ability to think critically and express their learning through well-crafted literary and argumentative writing.
Swimming in the Gene Pool: Genetics and Biodiversity (7th Grade)									
Swimming in the Gene Pool: Genetics and Biodiversity (7th Grade)
In the first semester, students will jump off the platform and dive into the diversity of organisms, including humans, throughout the world. Seventh graders will investigate the similarities and differences across the three domains of life, including the four kingdoms in Domain Eukarya, and 11 phyla in Kingdom Animalia. As a team, we will create and implement strategies to protect biodiversity within our local community. In the second semester, we will sprint right into Human Genetic Diversity. Students will connect their work in biodiversity to investigating the “why” and “how” of the genetics shaping our lives and societies. With the dual nature of our Expedition, we will apply our knowledge on biodiversity and genetics to investigate two key areas of diversity: 1) How differences within a species happen, from a molecular level to an environmental level. 2) Why these differences matter?
Designing the Future (8th Grade)									
Designing the Future (8th Grade)
This year long expedition challenges students to design a potential solution to an issue of injustice. It begins with a deep-dive into the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). They will also read The Giver by Lois Lowry, which will serve as a dystopian counter-example. These texts, combined with a number of focused case studies, will build student understanding of human rights violations that occur civilly in the United States, and provide a launching point for their creation of a prototype that intends to solve or alleviate an aspect of the problem. Students will learn the process of invention in science and utilize a design-thinking method to engineer a prototype to address the violation they have identified. Past examples include a solar powered vending machine for the homeless and a cell phone application that helps recent immigrants obtain proper documentation.
My Generation: Gender and Power in Popular Music (English I)									
My Generation: Gender and Power in Popular Music (English I)
During this Fall Expedition, students will analyze how messages about gender and power are communicated in popular music, examine the impact of those messages, and craft an argument for how consumers should respond.  The expedition will culminate with students creating videos synthesizing their learning over the course of the expedition, presenting their findings on the artist they chose and suggesting specific actions people can take in their everyday lives to advocate for gender equity. In order to meet this goal, students will read Persepolis by Marjane Satrapi, and participate in workshops from guest experts from Men Can Stop Rape, The Delaware Coalition Against Domestic Violence, and 826DC. All of this will support students in their critical thinking,  argumentative writing and academic discussion skills.
Wild DC: The Anadromous Fish Factor (Biology)									
Wild DC: The Anadromous Fish Factor (Biology)
In the Anadromous Fish Factor Expedition students will learn about Ecology through the lens of Anadromous fish in our local aquatic community. Through interactive fieldwork and work with experts in the field of fish ecology, students will explore the history of Anadromous fish in our community and the impact the Anadromous fish life cycle has on our local ecosystem. Students will also investigate the factors that affect biodiversity in our river community, the relationship between local organisms' populations and their environments, how the health of our watershed impacts organisms that live within it as well as human practices that will help restore and revitalize the local river community.
Water=Life (Chemistry I/ World History II)									
Water=Life (Chemistry I/ World History II)
Throughout the school year students will be working in chemistry to study the global water crisis. In the Fall semester, students will investigate bottled and tap water, study elements and compounds in our water, and analyze the water treatment process.  In addition, they will visit the chemistry lab at Trinity University to conduct water testing with Trinity students. In the second semester in World History II, students will study human rights and focus on issues connected to water as a human right in a current water crisis.  In the past we have looked at communities that are experiencing a water crisis such as Gaza and the Dominican Republic. Last year we studied the Dakota Access Pipeline and students produced an in-depth research paper that including graphs, data analysis of water clean up issues and a human rights analysis of the indigenous people. Students created a final proposal addressing questions about the building of the pipeline. This expedition builds students understanding of fundamental chemistry and skills needed to apply a human rights lens to a real world social justice problem while making authentic connections to how people’s lives may are affected.
Food Justice (Environmental Science/ English III)									
Food Justice (Environmental Science/ English III)
During this Spring Expedition, students will investigate issues of food justice in D.C. Their work will culminate in organizing and hosting the city-wide Food Justice Youth Summit, where they will present food justice workshops alongside other youth from around the region. In order to meet this goal, students will read books, scientific journal articles and other research about their food justice topic and synthesize that information into a literature review, a data analysis/ project, a research paper and finally, their food justice workshop. Students will visit Rocklands Farm, the University of the District of Columbia and a student-selected location, specific to their research topic. As students learn about the complex ways that our food system impacts communities and the environment, they will simultaneously hone their ability to research, synthesize and apply information from a variety of sources and perspectives. Most significantly, they will demonstrate their ability to advocate for change.
Senior Expedition (12th Grade)									
Senior Expedition (12th Grade)
As the capstone experience to their education at Capital City, 12th graders will design their own independent senior expedition research project exploring a topic they are passionate about. Their research culminates in a 10 page research paper, the creation of a product that serves the needs of a real-world audience, and a 50 minute panel presentation. In order to meet this goal, students will locate and read 25 scholarly articles, identify and interview two professionals in related fields, and schedule an interactive fieldwork that allows them to experience their topic first hand. After completing senior expedition, students are ready to excel at college-level research and writing, defend a provocative thesis with compelling evidence, and use the design cycle to tailor a product for a target audience.
