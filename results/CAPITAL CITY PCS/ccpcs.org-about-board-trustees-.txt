Board of Trustees
“Capital City is an extraordinary school that enables young people from diverse backgrounds to learn together in a positive, student-centered environment that emphasizes critical thinking and intellectual curiosity. The board plays an important part, working with the head of school to ensure we are the best we can possibly be for our students and families.” 
— Anne Wallestad, former Board member and CEO of BoardSource
A Board Making a Difference for DC Students
Capital City is governed by a Board of Trustees. Our volunteer Board provides oversight, support and expertise for the successful operation of the school. The Board of Trustees meets bi-monthly. While meetings are public, the Board reserves the right to hold closed executive sessions when dealing with confidential matters like personnel issues. For more information,
