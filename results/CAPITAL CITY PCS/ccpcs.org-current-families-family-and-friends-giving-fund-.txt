Family and Friends Giving Fund
“I support the Family & Friends Giving Fund as an important way to contribute to Capital City’s success and invest in the future of our children’s education.” 
— Cindy Runyan, Capital City Parent 
Every year, our diverse and dedicated community bands together to help Capital City provide an excellent education to every student by donating to the Family & Friends Giving Fund (previously Family Campaign). This annual fundraiser helps the school close the financial gap from what the city provides and what our education costs. 
Donations support program essentials such as:
Low student to teacher ratio for personalized instruction
Fieldwork and adventure trips that extend classroom learning
Comprehensive, integrated arts program for all students
Free after-school programs for middle and high school students
Help us reach our goal of 
100% participation from all families
. You can give to the Family & Friends Giving Fund at any time during the school year!
Give at 
www.ccpcs.org/donate
 or 
text CAPITALCITYPCS to 707070
 (message and data rates may apply). For questions or help setting up a monthly or one-time donation, email 
development@ccpcs.org
 or call 202.808.9748.
