Athletics
Capital City offers a comprehensive athletics program that teaches all of our students responsibility, goal-setting, sportsmanship, self-discipline, teamwork, and community building. 
After School Competitive Sports
With our extra-curricular athletics program, we strive to create an atmosphere where students feel safe to challenge themselves and their teammates in a way that builds skills, confidence and character. We emphasize sportsmanship, hard work, commitment, and respect for everyone on the playing field.  Through our athletic offerings, we attempt to provide something for every student and believe that there is an athlete within every student.  In fact, we offer the largest range of athletics of any DC charter school.  These programs are offered in addition to a robust physical education program provided during the school day.  
For team sports, we compete in both the DC Public Charter Athletics Conference and the Independent Small Schools Athletic Conference (ISSAC).  In recent years, we have won championships in basketball, soccer, and volleyball.
