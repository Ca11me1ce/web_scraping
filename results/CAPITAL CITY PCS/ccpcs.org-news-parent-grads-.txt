Parent Grads
Thanks to Head of School Karen Dresden, Family Engagement Coordinator Gerson Paniagua, Family Engagement Associate Nataly Stamy and our fabulous student and parent volunteers, 10 Capital City parents completed our first adult computer literacy program (7 sessions, 2 hours each).
Through interactive group activities, parents learned how to send emails, navigate the internet, use Google Translate and Drive, access our online grading platform, and connect with Capital City through our website and social media. Parents walked away with confidence in their ability to use a computer to support their child's learning. Each graduate also received a Chromebook at the end of the class!
