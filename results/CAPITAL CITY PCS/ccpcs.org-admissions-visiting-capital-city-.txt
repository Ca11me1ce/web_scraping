Visiting Capital City
About Our School
Capital City moved to our state-of-the art facility in August 2012. It is located at 100 Peabody Street, NW in Ward 4, about a mile from the Fort Totten and Takoma metro stations. Several bus routes also serve the neighborhood. 
Highlights of our school include:
The facility houses all PK-12th grades under one roof. We have developed distinct Lower, Middle, and High School programs, each with its own identity and space as well as principal and staff.
The move to Rabaut provided us with room to expand our elementary program to serve two classes per grade in keeping with our original charter and to add a program for three-year-olds to begin serving students earlier.
The Rabaut Campus is set on seven acres of land and abuts historic Fort Slocum Park, an ideal setting for our 
EL Education
 program. Expeditions have been significantly enhanced by our access to green space.
The Rabaut Campus has the capacity to support our arts and fitness programs that are so critical to our school’s mission, including a multi-functional
theatre
, a full-sized gymnasium, outdoor courts, mini-soccer pitch, and playing fields.
