“With the education you’re getting here at Capital City, you have everything you need to follow every last one of your dreams."
— Former First Lady Michelle Obama during her 2014 visit for our Senior College March to the Mailbox
Every year, the DC Public Charter School Board (PCSB) releases School Quality Reports. These are the results of an annual, multiple measure evaluation used to track school performance across the city. 
Our lower school and high school both achieved Tier 1 in 2017!
Our high school has been a Tier 1 School since 2013. Our lower school improved to Tier 1 in 2017. Our middle school scored at the high end of Tier 2 in 2017, continuing an upward trend towards Tier 1. At this rate, we are on track to reach our goal of Tier 1 for all campuses.
Capital City’s PCSB School Performance Reports for 2017 are available to download:

One measure used to evaluate school performance is PARCC. Beginning in the 2014-2015 school year, the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers (PARCC) became the testing standard for Washington, D.C. The graphs below show the percentage of our students demonstrating readiness for college and careers by scoring at level 4 or above on PARCC.
