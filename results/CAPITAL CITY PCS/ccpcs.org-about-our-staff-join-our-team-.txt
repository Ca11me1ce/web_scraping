We believe that educating the future leaders our community, and world, needs is the most important work out there. That's why we're committed to giving our teachers and staff a caring and welcoming community where everyone is supported and celebrated. 
We live fun and full lives while making a difference for nearly 1,000 students every year. 
Benefits at Capital City
We offer teachers a competitive salary that compensates for experience and growth. Over time, Capital City teachers can earn a six figure salary!
We offer a variety of health plans to ensure all staff and their families are covered. Plans include vision, dental, life insurance, long-term disability, and maternity and paternity leave. 
We care about the future of our employees and offer a tax deferred 403(b). We contribute 3% of staff salary and match up to an additional 3% of employee contributions.
We promote the happiness and well-being of all staff with personal and sick leave, laptops, and wellness activities such as free exercise classes and healthy snacks!
Career Advancement
Every week we dedicate time for professional development when students are dismissed early. Teachers receive individualized support, coaching, and external opportunities for growth.
We believe that students learn best when the adults who work with them collaborate and share with one another. Our culture of collegiality fosters the growth and development of new staff members.
We believe in shared leadership at Capital City. We provide many opportunities for teachers and staff to lead, whether they are serving on a curriculum team or leading an after school activity.

As a nationally-recognized, award-winning EL Education school,  our staff have a platform to share their work more broadly and impact the field. Capital City staff have opportunities to:
