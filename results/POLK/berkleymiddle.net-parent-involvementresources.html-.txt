﻿Our Mission:
BAMS is committed to inspiring our students to Believe in Better, to encourage them to aspire to higher learning, and challenge them to achieve their maximum individual potential while providing a supportive and safe educational environment.
​Our motto is: "Believe in Better!"
Formal Parent Partnership/Input​
Parent Volunteers-
All parents are invited to volunteer at school events.  A Fall and Spring survey are sent to all parents to sign up for their interested areas of volunteering.  These surveys are used to contact parents and form committees for the different events based on their input.
Parent Surveys-
All parents are sent surveys and climate inventories through BAMily emails and Remind.  These surveys and climate inventories are used to guide decisions and policies throughout the year.  Types include: yearly AdvancED surveys, Google event and/or specific idea surveys and voting.​
Parent Advisory Committee
- Meets each Spring to review school mission/vision statement using results from stakeholder feedback surveys. Meets each summer to plan for Orientation, review communication, and give input on upcoming school year events.  Meets each Fall to review school procedures and suggest spring events.
Informal Parent Participation:
You are a key member of the BAMily! Come have lunch with your child, meet with staff, attend arts, competitions, academic, sports and other events.  This is YOUR school!
