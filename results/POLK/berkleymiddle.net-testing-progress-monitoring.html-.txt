During the months of March through May, BAMS students will participate in the administration of state mandated standardized tests.  To help you and your student plan for the upcoming assessments, you are being provided with an explanation of the Florida Department of Education state testing policies and an outline of our testing schedule.  
It is important for parents and students to understand the following testing policies as set forth by the Florida Department of Education.  Letters were sent home in February to parents.  
Electronic Devices Policy—If students are found with ANY electronic devices, including, but not limited to, cell phones and smartphones, during testing OR during breaks, their tests will be invalidated. The best practice would be for students to leave devices at home on the day of testing.
 Leaving Campus—If students leave campus before completing the test (for lunch, an appointment, or illness, etc.), they WILL NOT be allowed to complete the test. Students and parents/guardians should be aware of this policy. If a student does not feel well on the day of testing, it may be best for the student to wait and test on the make-up day.  
Testing Rules Acknowledgment—Prior to testing, students will sign below a Testing Rules Acknowledgment on the back of the planning sheet that reads: “I understand the testing rules that were just read to me.   If I do not follow these rules, my test score may be invalidated.”
