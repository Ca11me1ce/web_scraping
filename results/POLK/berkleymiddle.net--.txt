BAMS is a School of Excellence
​​Section 1003.631, Florida Statutes, requires the State Board of Education to designate a school as a School of Excellence if the school’s percentage of possible points earned in its school grade calculation is in the 80th percentile or higher for schools comprised of the same grade groupings (elementary, middle, high, and combination) for at least two of the last three school years if the school meets the qualifying criteria.
BAMS is once again an "A" graded school from the State of Florida!
BAMS is a State of Florida Designated "High Performing Charter School"
Our Mission: 
The goal of BAMS is to have all students studying Algebra in grade 8 and reading on at least an 8th grade reading level thus allowing all students to follow whatever path they choose in higher education, college and career planning.
Our motto is: "Accelerated Learning for All; Whatever it t
akes".
