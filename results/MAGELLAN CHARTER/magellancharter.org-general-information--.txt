School Calendar and Hours
Magellan follows a traditional calendar (with slight modifications) with an 8:00 a.m. start time and a 2:35 p.m. end time. You can find a link to our current calendar on our home page. 
Students can enter the building between 7:30 and 8:00 a.m., and can be picked up from school between 2:35 and 3:00 p.m.
Transportation
Parents provide transportation to and from school. MaP, our parent/teacher partnership organization, helps parents coordinate carpool planning at the beginning of the school year by collecting and distributing information about families interested in sharing rides. Volunteers also help during afternoon carpool to keep student pick-up moving quickly.
Lunch
Students eat lunch in their classrooms or at outside picnic tables under the supervision of parent volunteers. Meals may be packed from home or purchased (optional) several times a week at school from local vendors. To learn more about pre-ordering lunches,

Magellan Charter School’s History
Two years after the North Carolina State Legislature passed the 1996 Charter School legislation allowing for the creation and establishment of independent public schools, Wake County teachers Marybeth Childers and George Coccarelli filed an application for what would become Magellan Charter School.
Believing that children in grades four through eight would benefit from a small, personal, and hands-on environment, they acted to create a school that could provide continuity during this time of rapid growth and development. This, they asserted, would help students maintain their focus on academics – the first priority for Magellan.
In March of 1997, the North Carolina State Board of Education approved Magellan’s charter. For the next six months the Magellan Board of Directors and a multitude of dedicated parents worked diligently to open the school. On August 25, 1997, Magellan became a reality and opened its doors to 294 new students.
Eventually, the charter was expanded to include third grade. And today, Magellan is home to a few more than 400 students served by a team of approximately 30 teachers.
