Magellan Charter School Counseling Services
The Magellan Charter School provides a developmental counseling program addressing the academic, personal, and social development of all students. In collaboration with parents, other school personnel, and community, the counseling program seeks to prepare all students with the skills and knowledge to contribute at the highest level as productive members of society.
Counseling Philosophy:
We believe that all students have dignity and worth and have the right to be served by a comprehensive school counseling program. We believe that all students have unique gifts and talents to be nurtured and have a capacity to learn and be supported academically. Our school counseling program will be consistent with expected developmental stages of learning and differences in learning styles.
We believe that our program will incorporate classroom, group and/or individual activities to enhance student learning. Our program will provide academic, personal and social development opportunities for all students. Evaluation of our program will determine its development and curriculum.
We also believe in abiding by the professional school counseling ethics as advocated by the American School Counselor Association. Our counselors will participate in professional development essential to maintaining a quality  school counseling program.
Counselors can help with….
Friendship/Peer Concerns
Changes in the Family
Illness and Loss
Academic Concerns

Parent Tips
Parent Tips for School Success
Be positive
– A positive attitude towards learning is the best gift you can give your student. Everything you learn, whether it is your most or least favorite subject, will help you grow as a person.
Get organized – and stay organized
. Create a learning space free from distractions and with all needed supplies at your fingertips. Use the agenda to note tests and quizzes, as well as, plan short and long term projects.
Teach time-management so that students can successfully accomplish what is most important. Doing so also makes it evident when a student is over committed.
Establish a routine for homework and studying. Doing so sets school as a priority and instills a strong work ethic.
Check agendas daily for homework assignments
 for younger students and routinely check teacher websites
 for older students to ensure all assignments are being completed. If homework is taking longer than would be expected, communicate with your child’s teacher.
Set personal goals 
with your students to help them stay on track.
Make the most of your resources
. Instill problem solving skills by having your child reach out for help when needed. Teachers, the counselor, and other staff are all available to help with academic concerns and/or socio-emotional concerns.
Limit time online or on cell phones. For older students that may have a cell phone or use online apps, give them a short period of time each day in which to check text messages or an app they may use.  All cell phones and online apps should be inaccessible during homework and studying and should be “docked” with parents for the night before bedtime. Remember to monitor in order to teach your child healthy online etiquette.
Encourage sleep, exercise, and a healthy diet.  
It is very important that your child has a healthy lunch each day.
Prioritize family time.
  It can help cushion stress and allows for open communication.
