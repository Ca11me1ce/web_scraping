About Legacy
Leading the way since 2011
Mission
Our mission is to provide motivated students with the opportunity to achieve academic excellence in an accelerated, back-to-basics, safe learning environment taught by caring, knowledgeable, and highly effective educators in cooperation with supportive, involved parents.
History
Legacy Traditional Schools believes there is no limit to what a student can achieve with great education and strong character. Our non-profit network of tuition-free, A-rated public schools was founded on this principle, and it underlies our mission to build lifelong learners and good citizens. Every Legacy Traditional School features a rigorous, well-rounded curriculum that emphasizes all areas of academic study, including the arts, physical education and extensive athletics and extracurricular activities. We serve 15,000 students across 13 campuses in Arizona (Greater Phoenix, northwest Tucson, Maricopa and Casa Grande) and Nevada (North Las Vegas). New campuses are coming to Phoenix and East Mesa, AZ, and Henderson, NV in 2017-18.
Working Together to Support the Mission
Our staff is dedicated to Legacy students, and it shows. Each of our highly-qualified teachers and dedicated staff members gives his/her all to ensure that each student is prepared for life.
You can see that our staff is an important partner in your child’s success. We teach, lead, inspire, and care the way you do.
Onward to the Future
We’re humbled to know where we started, and we continually look forward to the future. We plan on continuing to offer more students the quality education they deserve, wherever they may be. Look for exciting announcements for new Legacy campuses that change lives!
