Frequently Asked Questions
I do not remember my SchoolCare Works password? At the log in page click on the password reminder link and the system will email you a temporary password to the email address on file. Upon login, you will be prompted to change your password.
I don’t remember my SchoolCare Works username? Contact the Program Administrator at your campus. How are fees calculated? Tuition is calculated based upon the number of school days in the year. The annual tuition amount is then divided into ten equal monthly payments so that the monthly payments do not fluctuate. Monthly tuition does not include school closures or camp.
How do I withdraw my child from LKC? Complete a withdrawal form found behind the communication tab within your SchoolCare Works account and submit the form to 
communityeducation@legacytraditional.org
. The monthly fee applies regardless of enrollment or withdrawal date.
How do I change my child’s schedule? Log into your SchoolCare Works account and click on the attendance tile. Click on the pencil to end your schedule.
Why do I keep getting the “duplicate error found” message? This indicates the child has already enrolled in the program earlier this school year. TO re-enroll in the same program, a Re-enrollment form must be completed and sent to 
communityeducation@legacytraditional.org
.
Are half days included with LKC? If a student is enrolled in LKC Afterschool care, the half day is included and a free lunch is provided. Half days do not apply to students enrolled in Before school care. If a child is enrolled in LKC part-time Afterschool care, as long as the half day falls on their scheduled day of attendance, the child may attend. (Example: the child is scheduled for LKC Afterschool care Monday, Wednesday, Friday and the ½ day is on Friday, the child may attend.) (Non-Example: the child is scheduled for LKC Afterschool care Monday, Wednesday, Friday and the ½ day is on Friday, the child may attend.)
Who do I contact if I have questions about LKC? The Program Administrator at your campus. Their contact information can be found on your campus LKC page, or in the LKC Student Handbook.
