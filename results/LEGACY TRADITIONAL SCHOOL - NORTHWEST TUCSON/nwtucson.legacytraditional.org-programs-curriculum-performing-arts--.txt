Mozart Performing Arts
Finding Inspiration through Music
We don’t cut creativity, we expand it
You’ve probably seen lots of school districts making cuts to programs in their schools, for whatever reason. Many times, music and performing arts are the first things to go. That is really unfortunate, because in the end, it’s the children (and their creativity) that really feel the cuts. We created the Mozart Performing Arts program to help our students find inspiration through music.
Program features
Class Piano – Students learn basic keyboard skills in our state-of-the-art piano labs. Teachers can communicate and provide feedback to each student through headsets, allowing everyone to learn without distraction.
Instrumental Music – Students in 4th grade and beyond can select from a band or string instrument to perform with other students. They learn the basics of their instrument as well as concert literature, note reading, and performance. They have evening performances throughout the year to showcase what they have learned.
Vocal Performance – Students also have the choice to refine their skills as part of a choir or choral ensemble. The program helps students learn vocal technique, rhythm, melody, harmony, articulation, balance, blend, and dynamics. They showcase their progression through evening performances featuring a variety of music styles.
Music History and Theory – Mozart students will learn music history and theory through the Kodály Method, a proven curriculum built with the developing child in mind. They will gain an appreciation of musical theory through games, movement, singing, and exercises.
