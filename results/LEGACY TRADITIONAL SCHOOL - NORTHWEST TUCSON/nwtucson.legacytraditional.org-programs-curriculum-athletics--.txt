Mustang Athletics
“Home of the Mustangs”
We want our students to have the opportunity to participate in team sports to learn valuable life lessons. All sports are played in the Canyon Athletic Association (CAA) against other similar sized schools. We have opportunities for every student, even if they have never played the sport before.
See upcoming Mustangs sports events >
Here are the sports we currently offer at Legacy Northwest Tucson:
Flag Football
Flag football athletes learn skills including accountability, effort, and dedication. Everyone has the chance to learn multiple positions and find their passion on the football field.
Volleyball
Pass, set, hit, win! Student athletes learn the necessary individual and team skills that will set them up for success on future high school or club volleyball teams. 
Basketball
Separate girls and boys teams ensure that each athlete has significant time in our high school regulation gymnasiums to learn to be a better player on and off the court.
Girls Softball
Girls play on our beautiful fields right on campus. They learn individual skills such as batting, fielding, and throwing, but also how to come together to win the big game. 
Boys Baseball
The baseball players spend much time working on skills on the diamond. They have the chance to play other schools and test their grit and determination on a daily basis.
Soccer
Our co-ed soccer team is a great way to learn how individual effort affects team success. Our athletes stay in great shape and develop life-long skills.
Cross Country 
Cross Country is a great way for students to build confidence and focus on constant improvement. It is a highly individual effort with all the benefits of team encouragement and camaraderie.
