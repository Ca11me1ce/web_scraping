Legacy Academics and Curriculum
Accelerated, Back-to-Basics Education
English Language Arts
Our language arts program is based on the Spalding Method using The Writing Road to Reading (2012). As a total language arts program, Spalding integrates direct instruction in listening, speaking, spelling, writing, and reading. The Spalding mission is to develop skilled readers, critical listeners, accomplished speakers, spellers, writers, and lifelong learners. The following are crucial components of the Language Arts program:
Composition
Oral Communication
Reading/Literature
Spelling
Vocabulary
Mathematics
As an accelerated school, Legacy teaches Saxon Mathematics one full grade level above the student’s actual grade (e.g., a kindergarten student is taught using 1st grade curriculum). This program focuses on a spiral curriculum with continuous reinforcement by the inclusion of mastery and practical applications of basic mathematical practices. Students will understand that mathematical problems have absolute answers and that precision, accuracy, and fluency are required.
Science
Legacy’s science curriculum enables our students to construct an understanding of scientific concepts through investigation and analysis, the use of laboratory equipment, student readings, and interactive technology. Students exercise logical thinking and decision-making skills appropriate to their grade level.
Social Studies
The social studies program at Legacy includes the study of world history, U.S. history, Arizona history, and geography. Students also learn about responsible citizenship and America’s place in global history and economics.
Art
In Art class, students utilize a variety of media and techniques to create art projects that emulate historically significant artists and art styles. Students will learn essential art vocabulary as well as the basics of art history, the elements of art, and the principles of design.
English Language Learners
All ELL students receive daily instruction that is aligned with the Arizona State Structured English Immersion (SEI) models. Each daily lesson includes four hours of daily instruction in the areas of grammar, reading, writing, oral conversation, and content vocabulary.
Computers
Computer class introduces students to the basics of computer use, keyboarding, cyber-safety, and the use of various software programs for academic purposes.
Cornell Notes
We know that true learning requires the student to be an active participant. We teach our students the Cornell Note Method to enhance their experience at Legacy and beyond. Students learn a proven way of taking notes that is instrumental in helping retain and recall important information.
Exceptional Student Services
Legacy Traditional School’s Exceptional Student Services department oversees programming for students with disabilities or special needs. These programs are free, appropriate, public education services for students with disabilities (in accordance with state and federal statutes and regulations).
In addition, Legacy provides a challenging program for qualified gifted students in 7th and 8th grades. The Recognizing Individual Student Excellence (RISE) Program allows students to take part in problem-solving and critical thinking activities through various units of study across all disciplines.
AdvancED Certified
Legacy Traditional Schools are internationally accredited by AdvancED, a non-profit, non-partisan organization that conducts rigorous, on-site external reviews of PreK-12 schools and school systems. AdvancED is recognized as a leader in achieving educational quality by driving educational improvement through research and innovation, policy and advocacy, technology, and accreditation.
