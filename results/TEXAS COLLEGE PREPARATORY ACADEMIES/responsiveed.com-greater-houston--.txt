Our Premier High Schools are mastery-based programs designed to help students catch up in school, pursue a CTE pathway, or move more quickly toward graduation.
Our newest line of schools feature a blend of classical curriculum and 21st-century skills.
These mastery-based, college-preparatory high schools offer dual credit courses and a system which helps our students succeed at their own pace.
