OPERATING PRINCIPLES
We believe that every student has the ability and the right to learn. We believe that learning takes place best when educators, students, and parents share a common set of educational values and goals.
We believe and are committed to the application of technology as a tool in every classroom.
We believe our academic and arts programs will develop the inner disciplines and individual responsibilities needed to live productive lives.
We believe the self-esteem and individuality of a student will be developed as their artistic gifts are fine-tuned through various arts programs.
We believe that positive interactions and positive feedback from staff to students is the best way to encourage appropriate and desirable behavior and for promoting the development of good habits.
