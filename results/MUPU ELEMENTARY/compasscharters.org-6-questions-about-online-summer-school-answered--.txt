To those middle school and high school scholars looking to catch up or get ahead on academics this summer, Compass Charter Schools is the place to be! If you’ve never taken an online summer school course before, we’re sure you have a lot of questions. That’s why we’ve gathered the six most commonly asked questions and answered them all right here in this post! Check them out below:
How much will an online summer school course cost me?
We often hear this question, and the answer is two great words: tuition-free
! Compass Charter Schools is a year-round public charter school, and we offer all our courses (even summer) completely tuition-free for scholars 
throughout California
.
What will my class look like?
At Compass Charter Schools, you can say goodbye to spending long days stuck in a stuffy classroom all summer long. Instead, enjoy the comfort of your home or get some fresh air at a coffee shop! As long as you have a laptop and Internet connection, you can learn wherever you want.
Plus, our courses are designed specifically for you! Instead of having to read an outdated, boring textbook, we keep you engaged through our 
100% online, award-winning curriculum
 with teacher support, videos, and much more to help you get excited about learning!
How do I communicate with my teachers?
Compass Charter Schools has highly-qualified, state-certified teachers who are dedicated to helping our scholars catch up or get ahead. You will be able to contact your teachers via email, phone calls and chat messages within our Parent Scholar Portal (PSP). In many cases, our scholars report that they communicate with their teachers more here than in a traditional school setting.
I’m working a summer job; can Compass Charter Schools work with my schedule?
Absolutely! In fact, we’re probably your best option for summer school! While there will be about 15-20 hours of schoolwork you’re expected to complete each week, you are free to work on your courses on your schedule.
That’s the beauty of a 100% online school!  
Will I still get to interact with classmates?
Of course! At Compass Charter Schools, there are several opportunities to connect with your classmates. You will be able to chat with scholars in classroom discussions as well as in the community page of our Parent Scholar Portal, and more!
How long do online summer school courses last?
Compass Charter School’s tuition-free summer school courses are just four weeks long! That means you’ll be able to knock out a course and still have time to enjoy your summer.
Our first summer session starts on Tuesday, July 3. To enroll, head to 
www.compasscharters.org
 or give us a call at 
877-506-8631.
