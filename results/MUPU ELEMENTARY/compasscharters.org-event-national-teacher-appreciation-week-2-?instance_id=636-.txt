Teachers change the lives of millions of children every day, and their work and impact extends far beyond the boundaries of the classroom. Take the time to show your appreciation this week. 
Post. Tweet. Tag #ThankATeacherTell us why you love your Compass Charter Schools teachers! Take a picture or video, and share it with us on social media by tagging @CompassCS (and your teacher’s Twitter handle) and using the hashtag #ThankATeacher.
Here are a few other ways you can get involved:
Have your scholar present thank-you cards to their teachers!
On Thursday, upload a #TBT of you and your favorite teacher and thank them using the hashtag #ThankATeacher.
Take a picture of your scholar holding a piece of paper with a simple message saying Thank You to a teacher and why you’re thanking him or her.
