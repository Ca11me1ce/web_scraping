Compass Charter Schools (CCS) believes every scholar can be successful and understands and respects the need for scholars to learn at their own pace, using their own learning strengths. Our program is built to foster and develop scholars’ love of learning. CCS is committed to creating a collaborative virtual learning community, inspiring scholars to appreciate the ways in which arts and sciences nurture a curiosity for lifelong learning, and preparing scholars to take responsibility for their future successes. We do this by offering two independent study options for all grades in Kindergarten through 12th grade: Online and Home Study.
We are proud of the quality program we provide. As we are a virtual school, many of our procedures take advantage of digital tools. For example, Learning Coach Lounges, scholar clubs, and communication are conducted virtually. For our scholar portfolios, we use an application that can be accessed on a phone, tablet, or computer. These digital tools allow us to enhance our scholars’ learning, as well as the relationships and communication we have with them and each other. While a virtual community is important to us, we also try to build in-person communities with a variety of enrichment events, workshops, and field trips.
School Accountability Report Cards
Since November 1988, state law has required all public schools receiving state funding to prepare and distribute a SARC. A similar requirement is also contained in the federal No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act. The purpose of the report card is to provide parents and the community with important information about each public school. A SARC can be an effective way for a school to report on its progress in achieving goals. The public may also use a SARC to evaluate and compare schools on a variety of indicators.
