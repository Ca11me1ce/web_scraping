Young Athletes
Young Athletes
Young athletes often spend many hours honing their skills that in turn improve their game. When these young athletes begin training seriously for competitions, families find it difficult to help their children balance their time and efforts toward academic goals if they are in a traditional classroom setting. Young athletes feel the pressure that many of their peers do to complete their school work however they feel it exponentially greater due to the limited time they have to complete their all work while maintaining their athletic 
schedule
. 
The typical schedule of an athlete can be very busy (even for an adult). Imagine trying to leave the house early in the morning to practice, go to school, participate in extracurricular activities, complete homework, study, and spend time with family each day. Families of scholars who are busy athletes need a more flexible educational situation that allows them choices that support both academic and athletic potential. 
The dedicated staff of Compass Charter Schools (CCS) is sensitive to the needs of aspiring young athletes. We understand their desire for flexibility and a quality personalized learning experience, and are proud to offer our Compass Experience to meet their unique needs. Both our Online and Homeschool programs provide the flexibility that families desire while maintaining the academic consistency they need. In addition, our 
counseling team
 is available to help provide even more support to help the scholar succeed. CCS also offers various 
field trips, enrichment activities and clubs
 for scholars that seek an additional enrichment experience. 
Our 
Online Program
 offers a virtual education with caring, dedicated teachers who provide live online classes each week. In addition, teachers offer a weekly Q&A session to offer added support when scholars need more help with their work. High School courses provide subject-specific credentialed teachers just as you would find in a brick-and-mortar school. Our teachers truly want to see each scholar succeed. 
Our 
Homeschool (Options) Program
 is for the parent looking to be the primary instructor for the scholar. We provide instructional funds, school support staff and a team of Educational Facilitators (EF) ready to provide academic guidance, support and encouragement as scholars experience school at home. Compass provide families with $2,800 in allocated instructional funds for K-8 scholars and $3,000 for scholars in grades 9-12. These allocated funds are for use with our approved vendors. Our team of EFs support and guide the scholar and learning coach / parent as they partner with families on the scholar’s educational journey.
Compass Charter Schools is proud to be able to support young athletes as they work hard to balance their sports and educational careers.
