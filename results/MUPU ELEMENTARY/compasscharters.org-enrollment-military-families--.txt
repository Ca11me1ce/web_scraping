Military Families
Military Families
There are over 2 million military children, and many have unique challenges they must face in their lives. Because military parents are often transferred, their children must also move several times and often it is with little warning. When parents are deployed, their children have had to say goodbye with the stress of not knowing when they will see them again and they may have had to do this several times. These transitions can have a negative effect on the academic performance of these children. Beyond the effect on academics, there is also the potential for social-emotional struggles and social relationship difficulties due to various transitions between various educational institutions. Children of our military should not be left to struggle due to the brave choice their families have made to serve our country. 
Compass Charter Schools (CCS) staff understand the military family’s desire for flexibility and a quality personalized learning experience, and are proud to offer our Compass Experience to meet their unique needs.  Both our Online and Homeschool programs provide the flexibility that families desire while maintaining the academic consistency they need. In addition, our 
counseling team
 is available to help provide even more suppo
rt to help the scholar succeed. CCS also offers various 
field trips, enrichment activities and clubs
 for scholars that seek an additional enrichment experience. 
Our 
Online Program
 offers a virtual education with caring, dedicated teachers who provide live online classes each week. In addition, teachers provide a weekly Q&A session to offer added support when scholars need more help with their work. High School courses are supported by subject-specific credentialed teachers just as you would find in a brick-and-mortar school. Our teachers truly want to see each scholar succeed. 
Our
Homeschool (Options) Program
 is for the parent looking to be the primary instructor for the scholar. We provide instructional funds, school support staff and a team of Educational Facilitators (EF) ready to provide academic guidance, support, and encouragement as scholars experience school at home. Compass provides families with $2,800 in allocated instructional funds for K-8 scholars and $3,000 for scholars in grades 9-12. These allocated funds are for use with our approved vendors. Our team of EFs support and guide the scholar and learning coach/parent as they partner with families on the scholar’s educational journey.
CCS is proud to be a member of the 
Military Child Education Coalition (MCEC)
. The MCEC’s work is focused on ensuring quality educational opportunities for all military children affected by mobility, family separation, and transition. CCS is part of this community of partners committed to supporting an environment where military-connected children thrive.
