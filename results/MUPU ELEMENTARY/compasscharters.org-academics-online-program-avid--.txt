AVID
AVID is not just another program… at its heart, AVID is a philosophy
” Hold scholars accountable to the highest standards, provide academic and social support, and they will rise to the challenge”
What is AVID?
AVID, Advancement Via Individual Determination, is a college readiness system for 
elementary-aged scholars
 through higher education that is designed to increase school-wide learning and performance. The AVID College Readiness System (ACRS) accelerates scholar learning, uses research-based methods of effective instruction, provides meaningful and motivational professional learning, and acts as a catalyst for systemic reform and change. While typically found in brick-and-mortar schools, Compass is proud to be one of a select few who are offering this program online.
The AVID curriculum, based on rigorous standards, is driven by the WICOR method, which stands for Writing, Inquiry, Collaboration, Organization and Reading. AVID curriculum is used in AVID elective classes and in content-area classes (English language arts, math, science, and social studies) in AVID schools. Our teachers use AVID strategies in both their Learning Labs and Q&A sessions.

Why participate in AVID?
98% of California AVID students graduate high school!
80% of California AVID students get accepted to a 4 year University!!
Scholars have fun, learn skills and work on team building! AND it’s a great social support!
Scholars in AVID recognize that getting into a four-year university is not easy, especially for a first-generation college student.  AVID seeks to ensure that scholars not only get accepted to a four-year university, but that they are also prepared to succeed once they are there.
AVID’s mission is to close the achievement gap by preparing all students for college readiness and success in a global society, which fits perfectly with our vision to create a collaborative virtual learning community, inspiring scholars to appreciate the ways in which arts and sciences nurture a curiosity for lifelong learning, and prepare scholars to take responsibility for their future success.
