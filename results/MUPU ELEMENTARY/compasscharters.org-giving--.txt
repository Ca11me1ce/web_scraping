Giving to the Annual Fund
The Annual Fund is Compass Charter Schools’ first giving priority and the fundraiser in which we invite every family to participate.
Dollars raised through the Annual Fund benefit every K-12 Compass Charter Schools scholar and provide critical operating funds to help bridge the gap between what the state provides and what it really costs to deliver the outstanding education we want for our children.
There are many ways to give to Compass Charter Schools!
1. Online – preferred method
Make a secure online donation. You can make a one-time and/or recurring monthly gift.
2. Check
Make checks payable to Compass Charter Schools and drop off or mail to:
Compass Charter Schools
Attn: J.J. Lewis, President & CEO
850 Hampshire Road, Suite P
Thousand Oaks, CA 91361
Please provide your name, address, email, and scholars name, if applicable, with your check.
3. Stock

5. Matching Gifts
Many local companies have matching gift programs that can double or even triple your gift. Contact your company’s H.R. office to find out if it has a matching gift program. If it does, provide us with the paperwork and we’ll do the rest!
​
We are extremely grateful for your support and continued dedication to Compass Charter Schools.
Thank you for your generous support!
