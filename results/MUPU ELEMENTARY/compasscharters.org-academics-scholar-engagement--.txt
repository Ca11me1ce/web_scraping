Scholar Engagement
Scholar Engagement
CCS Clubs are scholar-driven, guided by an experienced staff member, and meet virtually on a regular basis. The purpose of CCS Clubs is to create a safe scholar-driven community of like-minded individuals to explore a particular topic of focus together, primarily in the online forum. Some clubs offer outings or in-person meet-ups called “Club Excursions.” Taking part in organized clubs can not only equip children with new physical skills but also gives scholars an opportunity to meet new people and form new friendships, which often leads to an increase in confidence and thus, independence.
​
Field Trips offer our scholars educational experiences to expand their knowledge of the world around them and discover their passions, within a safe environment where they can explore the real life options available to them. By seeing real-life applications of concepts they study, scholars are more apt to gain a deeper understanding of what they are learning. Whether in person or virtual, CCS Field Trips personally connect scholars with peers and staff within our CCS community. Field Trips are scheduled throughout the year and are organized around a monthly educational theme.
Enrichment Activities are offered in our CCS Learning Centers on a monthly basis, focusing on topics of interest to scholars and Learning Coaches. Topics include college and career preparation, exploration of the arts and sciences, community service projects, and other special events. We seek to provide enrichment programs that expose our scholars to unique experiences that enhance their knowledge, and background and encourage them to develop new passions and skills. These activities allow them become explorers and discoverers of the world they live in.
