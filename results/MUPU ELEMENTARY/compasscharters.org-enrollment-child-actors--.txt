Child Actors
Child Actors
Trying to manage career goals as an actor in Hollywood can be quite a daunting task. Many adult actors end up walking away because of that. When the actor is a child, the challenge can be even more overwhelming. Keeping up with the continuous acting, dancing, and voice training, plus the last minute 
auditions and film shoots, leaves little time for these child actors to complete homework and maintain a consistent school schedule. 
Imagine trying to leave the house at seven in the morning, participate in extracurricular activities, complete homework, study, spend time with your family all while trying to fit in time for auditions, filming or acting classes. This is understandably a daunting schedule. Scholars who are professional actors need to be given more flexibility to accommodate the extra time constraints that participating in commercials, film etc affords. Luckily for them, there are now more educational options to support them. 
The dedicated staff of Compass Charter Schools (CCS) is sensitive to the needs of child actors. We understand their desire for flexibility and a quality personalized learning experience and are proud to offer our Compass Experience to meet their unique needs.  Both our Online and Homeschool programs provide the flexibility that families desire while maintaining the academic consistency they need. In addition, our 
counseling team
 is available to help provide even more support to help the scholar succeed. CCS also offers various 
field trips, enrichment activities and clubs
 for scholars that seek an additional enrichment experience. 
Our 
Online Program
 offers a virtual education with caring, dedicated teachers who provide live online classes each week. In addition, teachers provide a weekly Q&A session to offer added support when scholars need more help with their work. High School courses are supported by subject-specific credentialed teachers just as you would find in a brick-and-mortar school. Our teachers truly want to see each scholar succeed. 
Our
Homeschool (Options) Program
 is for the parent looking to be the primary instructor for the scholar. We provide instructional funds, school support staff and a team of Educational Facilitators (EF) ready to provide academic guidance, support and encouragement as scholars experience school at home. Compass provides families with $2,800 in allocated instructional funds for K-8 scholars and $3,000 for scholars in grades 9-12. These allocated funds are for use with our approved vendors. Our team of EFs support and guide the scholar and learning coach/parent as they partner with families on the scholar’s educational journey.
Compass Charter Schools is proud to be able to support young actors and actresses as they work hard to balance their educational and acting careers.
