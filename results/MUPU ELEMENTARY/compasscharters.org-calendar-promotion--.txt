Promotion
Our Compass Charter School scholars make us so proud! The 8th-grade promotions ceremonies in Sonoma, Fresno, Los Angeles and San Diego were such heartfelt celebrations of our scholars who are now moving on to high school. We are so excited for them and for our High School team, who will have the privilege of having these self-directed, compassionate scholars in their classes. Congratulations scholars and welcome to High School!
