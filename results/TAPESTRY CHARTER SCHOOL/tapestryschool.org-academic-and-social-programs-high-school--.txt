Message from the Principal - 05-07-18
Dear Tapestry 6-12 Families, 
This week I would like our students and families to continue think deeply about the trait of perseverance and how it can be demonstrated in all aspects of life. I would like to acknowledge our 10th grade scholars who demonstrated the trait of perseverance by presenting their passage portfolios on Thursday and Friday. 10th graders have been working hard and spent the last two months in preparation for presenting their passages.  Passage portfolios provide our students with the opportunity to reflect on their first two years of high school and justify why they are ready to continue at Tapestry as an 11th grader.
"If you can't fly then run, if you can't run then walk, if you can't walk then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward."  -  Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
Please remind your student that they are not to be on campus past 4:00 pm on school days unless they are involved in an after school sport, club, detention, or attending a school function. Students who are on campus after 4:00 without a purpose may be subjected to disciplinary action. Also, electronics are not allowed during the school day. All cell phones should be handed in upon arrival and locked in the cell phone carts. With warmer weather approaching please send your student to school dressed in appropriate attire and refer to our student family handbook for specifics on Tapestry dress guidelines.

Let’s make it a great week Tapestry.
Sincerely,
Dan DiCamillo
