School Pledge
      Each morning at the Millennium Community School students start their academic day with reciting positive affirmations. Below are the affirmations recited:        
Education is our number one priority. 
        I will be better today than yesterday. 
        I will think, I will listen, I will learn. 
        I will do all I can to be the genius I am. 
        I was born with everything I need to be the smartest in the world. 
        Everyday my actions and work will prove it! Everyday my actions and work will prove it! 
        Today, I will try and try! I will never give up! I will persevere to the very end. I will be great! I know it! I know it, therefore I will. 
        When I get to the top of the mountain, I will help someone else to make the climb to be as great as I am and will be. 
          Excuses and Self Confidence 
        To counteract negative thinking, the following is recited: 
        Excuses are tools of incompetence that build monuments of nothingness and those who specialize in their use rarely accomplish anything. I will not make excuses. I can do anything I put my mind to. No matter what other people say I cannot do, I know I CAN. I think positive and not negative. I will never say I can't. I CAN IF I TRY!
