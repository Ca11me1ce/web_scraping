Notice to Contractors
California Assembly Bill (AB) 1565 went into effect on January 1, 2014.  AB 1565 requires ALL General Contractors and M/E/P Subcontractors be prequalified, if the contract is valued at $1 million or more and funded whole or in part with State Facility Bond funds.
This applies to the following license numbers:
•     General Contractors (A and B)
•     Mechanical, Engineering, and Plumbing subcontractors (C-4, C-7, C-10, C-16. C-20, C-34. , C-36, C-38, C-42, C-43 and C-46).
Sanger Unified School District has contracted with Colbi Technologies, Inc. to provide a web-based process for prequalification called Quality Bidders.  To get started please visit:  
www.qualitybidders.com
 and review the following instructions.
The District must receive applications at least ten (10) business days prior to the scheduled bid opening on any advertised project in order for the candidate to qualify for that project.  Pre-qualification approval will remain valid for one (1) calendar year from the date of notice of qualification except as noted in the pre-qualification documents.
Please contact Deborah Flores with any questions at email: 
deborah_flores@sanger.k12.ca.us
.  You may also contact 
support@qualitybidders.com
 with any questions about the use of the QualityBidders web-based tool.
Thank you for your interest in prequalifying and working with Sanger Unified School District.
