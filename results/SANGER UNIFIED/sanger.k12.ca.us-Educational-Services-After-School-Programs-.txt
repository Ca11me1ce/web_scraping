Homeless & Foster Youth Enrollment
The After School Education and Safety Program Act of 2002, enacted by initiative statute, establishes the After School Education and Safety Program to serve pupils in grades 1 to 9, inclusive, at participating public elementary, middle, junior high, and charter schools. The act gives priority enrollment in after school programs and before school programs to pupils in middle school or junior high school who attend daily.
This bill, beginning July 1, 2017, would instead give first priority enrollment to pupils who are identified by the program as homeless youth, as defined, and pupils who are identified by the program as being in foster care,
 and 2nd priority enrollment, for programs serving middle and junior high school pupils, to pupils who attend the program daily. The bill, beginning July 1, 2017, would require an after school program or a before school program to inform the parent or caregiver of a pupil of the right of homeless children and foster children to receive priority enrollment and how to request priority enrollment. The bill, beginning July 1, 2017, would require the administrators of a program to allow self-certification of the pupil as a homeless youth or a foster youth, and would authorize administrators to obtain this informationthrough the school district liaison designated for homeless children, as specified.
IMPORTANT:
To receive priority enrollment in the after school programs next year for a foster/homeless youth, apply between April 24th and May 11th, 2018, with Lisa Torres in the LEAP office at the Sanger Unified District Office, at 1905 7th Street, Sanger, California
After May 11th, and once the program is fully enrolled, new foster/homeless youth applications will be placed at the top of the waiting list.
Please contact Lisa Torres for more information at 524-6564

Support After School Programs
After school programs keep kids safe, help working families and improve academic achievement. More than 28 million children today have parents who work outside the home. Two-thirds of Americans say that it is difficult to find programs in their communities and that not enough programs are available.
Studies show that students involved in after school programs get better grades, attend school more and have improved behavior. They express greater hopes for the future and more interest in school. Teens who participate in after school programs are less likely to skip class, use marijuana and other drugs, smoke, drink alcohol or engage in other risky behaviors.
