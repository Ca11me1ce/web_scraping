California Healthy Kids Survey
The California Healthy Kids Survey will be administered from October 23-November 9, 2017.  All 5th through 12th grade students in Sanger are being asked to participate. The Healthy Kids Survey is provided by the California Department of Education (CDE) to assess key school climate and student health and behavior factors.  Research has linked these indicators to academic performance, including test score improvement, positive youth development and well being.  This information is used to guide efforts to reduce studentrisk behaviors and build schools that are drug-free, safe and supportive environments for all students.  
Participation in the survey is voluntary on the part of the student.  We hope you will give permission so that your child's opinion and knowledge can be part of the information gleaned from the survey.
The survey is anonymous. No names or any other identifying information is connected to the answers except for the name of the school.  If you have any questions, you may contact your school site.
