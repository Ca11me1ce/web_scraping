Program Focus: The focus of Sanger Unified Health Services is the prevention, identification, modification, and resolution of health related problems that interfere with a student's ability to achieve in the school environment. SUSD's Health Services Team is comprised of Professional School Nurses, Licensed Vocational Nurses (LVN's), and trained Health Aides.
Sanger Unified School Health Offices are staffed as follows: Sanger High has a full time Registered School Nurse, a full time LVN, and a part time Health Aide. Washington Academic Middle School has a full time Registered School Nurse and a full time LVN. Elementary, K-8 and Charter sites are staffed part-time by Registered School Nurses, LVN's and/or Health Aides. A Registered Nurse is on call (accessible by cell phone) during all times students are on campus.
Registered School Nurses in the district manage the overall operation of their site(s) health office(s), including: maintenance of health records, emergency response, special education and 504 plan health assessments, staff development and required staff training to support Individualized Student Health Plans and Emergency Care Plans, state mandated health screenings, and ongoing training & supervision of SUSD LVN's and Health Aides. They are also available to consult with parents, students & staff regarding other student health concerns.
LVN's and/or Health Aides, under the direction and supervision of their School Nurse, assist with: maintenance of student health records, general assessments of ill students, first aid for school-related injuries, emergency response, CPR instruction, and the administration of medication and/or treatments for students as ordered by their physician.
