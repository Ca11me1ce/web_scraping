What is the Personnel Commission?
The Personnel Commission administers and oversees the merit system for classified (non-teaching) applicants and employees at Sanger Unified School District (SUSD) by creating policy. The fundamental purpose is to ensure that employees are selected, promoted and retained without favoritism or prejudice on the basis of merit and fitness, to work with the governing board and administration, and to see that classified employees receive fair and equitable treatment.
The Commission is an independent body composed of three persons appointed for three-year staggered terms. The Commission employs a Director of Classified Personnel (Vicki Roth) and an HR Technician (Hope Lucero).

What is the Merit System?
The merit system consists of rules and procedures which govern classified (non-teaching) school personnel as enacted by the State Legislature and the Personnel Commission. Employees at SUSD must take a written test, an oral examination or a performance test, and an additional oral interview by Department or School site administration.
The merit system was voted into existence by SUSD employees in 1969. Over half of all classified employees in the State of California work for merit system school districts.
These rules and procedures are listed in the Education Code of the State of California and in the Classified Rules and Regulations of the SUSD Personnel Commission. A copy of the Education Code-Merit System is available by clicking on the click below. A copy of the Rules and Regulations are available by clicking on the side bar to the left. Both documents are available by contacting the Personnel Commission office at 559-524-6521.
