  Parent Involvement
Importance of Parent Involvement in School
Studies have indicated that children whose parents and/or other significant adults share in their formal education tend to do better in school. Some benefits that have been identified that measure parental involvement in education include:
Higher grades and test scores
Long term academic achievement
Positive attitudes and behavior
More successful programs
More effective schools
All parents want their children to become successful, caring adults. Similarly, many parents want to be involved with the formal education of their children. Sometimes, however, they don't know where to start, when to find the time, or how to go about making positive connections with the school. At the most basic level, parents can begin encouraging the education of their children by showing that they truly value education themselves.
