Recruitment
Sanger Unified is a merit system school district. The merit system consists of rules and procedures which cover classified employees including the application/hiring process. All applications are reviewed to ensure the application is complete and the applicant meets minimum qualifications as stated on the job announcement. All candidates who apply for a position receive notification as to whether or not he/she will continue in the recruitment process.

Confirmation that candidate meets minimum qualifications. 
Failure to submit an application or list educational or work experience required to meet minimum qualifications by the filing deadline will cause an application to be denied. Sanger Unified cannot be responsible for application or electronic mail submission failure or lost or undeliverable US mail.
