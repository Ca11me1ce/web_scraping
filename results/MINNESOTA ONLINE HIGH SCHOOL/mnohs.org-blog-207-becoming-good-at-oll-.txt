Student blogger Austin Tenter on what it takes to succeed as an online learner.
I’ve talked a little about how I found MNOHS, but what is the average day really like? Well the big thing that everyone talks about is the freedom. You choose your own time to do assignments and you have one week to do them. This sounds great, which it is, but this can also be your biggest downfall. At a bricks-and-mortar school you have a daily schedule. The teacher gives lectures and shows you how to do certain things; they tell you what to write down and remember, and you do certain assignments in class so you don’t have to bring them home. In online school it’s all on you. Certain classes like science or math will probably have videos for you to watch. And most classes have a weekly meeting. Other than that, you have to basically motivate yourself. You have to actually look things up, read through the books and observe diagrams to soak the information up instead of having someone tell you.
I struggled through my first year at MNOHS. Going from structured to unstructured is a big change. I wasn’t organized and I didn’t keep a schedule which lead to some bad grades. As the weeks progressed I tended to procrastinate more and more which led to a snowball effect of poor grades. Once I realized how things were run, I had to get with the program. The next year I actually kept a calendar, set up folders for each of my classes on my computer, and had a good schedule going. I would do one full class a day, with 4 or 5 classes it’s kind of like a regular school week only you’re in your pajamas. And it’s much more satisfying. Forcing yourself to learn may be hard at first, but the knowledge you soak up stays with you.  it felt amazing having all B’s or A’s from work I really tried hard on when I used to have D’s because of not really trying.
If you want to have a successful year you need to plan ahead, make a schedule, and stay organized. Keep backup copies of your work in case something goes wrong. And go to the meetings. Most people including myself thought that the meetings weren’t really that big of a deal, and because you can also watch the recording of the meeting it makes not going seem justifiable. But if you can go you should go. Most of the teachers try to make it as interesting as possible. They use the time to help you to think about things you wouldn't on your own, and to organize the rest of your week.
One other thing you should know is the staff at MNOHS is really, really great. They give great feedback and even if you have a 100 point assignment due tomorrow some teachers can give you a few days extra to work on it or they can just help you with it in a meeting. All you have to do is ask and they’ll do what they can to help. So there it is, as long as you’re organized and sticking to your schedule--and asking for help when you need it--you should have a less stressful school year where you’re in control.

Students and parents talk
					"I wanted a school where I can do work at my own pace and not be stressed out over a complicated schedule of assignments. MNOHS is flexible, easy to use, and very welcoming. The faculty and staff are very informative when needed, very helpful, very friendly, and very involved, and very understanding--and that is a huge bonus." -Brandon							
					"I chose MNOHS because it presents me with the opportunity to work full time and also finish up my remaining credits. I landed an awesome job as an assistant at an engineering firm during the summer and I didn't want to give it up. Now I will be able to pay for my college as I go and not have to deal with debt." -Nikolet							
					"I just wanted to tell you a massive thank you. If it wasn’t for MNOHS I would never have discovered my passion for writing and for literature. MNOHS helped me improve my self-esteem so much and that is something which has benefited me on many levels not just academically." -Efi							
					"Thank you again for helping me grow as a learner in math and not giving up when I wanted to." -Naomi							
					"I really appreciate the comments left on my assignments. They help me a lot to stay motivated and on track.  And I also really appreciate that my teachers will help me work a little bit ahead so I can take a week or two off when my son arrives so I can adjust to being a mother!"  -Cassidy							
					"Thanks for giving Lindsay so many opportunities to express her opinions about the different issues in health class.  This led to many interesting and important discussions in our family. Because Lindsay is working in class right here at home, she tells me a lot more about what she is learning at MNOHS."  -Lori B.							
					"My son has made a wonderful progress and is doing so much better with MNOHS. He is developing a healthier schedule and he actually gets excited when he does his schoolwork which is a HUGE surprise for me ! I want to applaud your staff for all of their efforts. They are on top of it and motivate my son with positive reinforcement." -Franchesca							
					"Before I enrolled in the Student Leadership Experience Advisory, I did not realize that the staff is continuously looking at ways to improve the learning process for their students. I appreciated being able to sit in on meetings with school staff, to gain an understanding of their roles and responsibilities." -Trevor							
					"I want to take this time to tell you that this has been one of my favorite science classes (Chemistry) I have ever taken. It is so different, allowing me to learn at my own pace. I am able to do classwork without the distractions that other students at school.  I am definitely recommending MNOHS to my friends!" -Grace							
					"MNOHS works great for me! I have only half of my right leg and I've been suffering from problems that have hampered my ability to walk. It has truly been a blessing to be able to work towards my diploma from home. Even greater--I definitely don't have to worry about the stares of high school kids. The teachers here are incredibly encouraging." -Victoria							
					"I enrolled at MNOHS because it was too hard for me to concentrate in a classroom environment. I have slight ADD so it's really hard for me to pay attention. At least online I can work on my assignments and take a break before I have to finish them." -Mario							
					"MNOHS provides the only schedule that allows me to stay in a treatment program and still work on my high school degree. I'm having success in treatment for the first time and I'm proud of my accomplishments. I am a bright individual that looks forward to graduating from high school and hopefully gaining the confidence to go to college." -Kelli							
					"I would like to thank you for helping me understand what is needed to be said in an essay.  I was always aware of the three parts of an essay, but I was just unable to produce one that was any good. So again I thank you." -Dominic							
					"At MNOHS, I receive one on one attention from the teachers far superior to that of the traditional classroom of one teacher and 24 to 32 students. I believe I am learning so much more in this program than I did in the classroom because of the attention I receive from the teachers." -Eric							
					"My parents were pushing me to graduate and this program was sort of a last effort to finish up. I really struggled until I woke up to what I want. I want a better job and that's what this is all about for me." -Jason							
					"At my other school I felt that the class time was a lot of times wasted. The teachers were forever telling someone to be quiet, and having to reprimand someone else for their behavior. Online I am able to focus, get down to business, and finish without any interruptions. This is a better environment for me." -Jayna							
					"Having a chance to better my communication skills online has given me a greater confidence in my interactions with other people. I have seen significant changes in myself. I've seen growth as a thinker, learner, and writer." -Barbara							
					"All the replies to my assignments were very positive. Even when I needed to work on the lesson a little more there was no negativity in my teacher's suggestions. That's very good for me because I never much felt much support in high school it seemed all negative--so MNOHS was very refreshing." -Paul							
					"I finally realized that I want to go to college. Just about a month ago I was just going to finish high school and that was it. But after researching that project on computer engineering, I have found that that is really what I want to do. Thanks for all your encouragement. You saw something in me that I didn't see in myself." -Anna							
					"I miss working with you! I am grateful for the input you gave to me on my assignments. I learned a lot from the course and I developed my writing skills. Thank you for your encouragement. You guided me to learn and to share. I am starting to use these skills in communicating with others."   -Kristina							
					"In the beginning, I wondered what kind of teachers would teach via the computer. After working with you, I now know it takes a lot of talent to teach this way, especially when you consider all the different personalities and learning styles. On top of being extremely patient and caring, you are also very educated and true professionals in every sense of the word." -Adam
