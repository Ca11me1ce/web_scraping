About the PSEO program:
Postsecondary Enrollment Options (PSEO) is a program that allows 10th-, 11th- and 12th-grade students in Minnesota to earn both high school and college credit while still in high school, through enrollment in and successful completion of college-level, nonsectarian courses at eligible participating postsecondary institutions. Most PSEO courses are offered on the campus of the postsecondary institution; some courses are offered online. Each participating college or university sets its own requirements for enrollment into the PSEO courses. Eleventh and 12th-grade students may take PSEO courses on a full- or part-time basis; 10th graders may take one career/technical PSEO course. If they earn at least a grade C in that class, they may take additional PSEO courses.
There is no charge to PSEO students for tuition, books or fees for items that are required to participate in a course. Students must meet the PSEO residency and eligibility requirements and abide by participation limits specified in Minnesota Statutes, section 124D.09. Funds are available to help pay transportation expenses for qualifying students to participate in PSEO courses on college campuses.
For more information about PSEO, begin by contacting the college admission office to discuss the enrollment process and admission requirements.  Also speak to your MNOHS counselor.  MNOHS will provide information about PSEO to all students and their families by March 1, every year.  MNOHS students must notify their MNOHS counselor by May 30 if they want to participate in PSEO for the following school year.  Current information about the PSEO program can also be found on the 
Minnesota Department of Education’s Postsecondary Enrollment Options (PSEO) webpage.
