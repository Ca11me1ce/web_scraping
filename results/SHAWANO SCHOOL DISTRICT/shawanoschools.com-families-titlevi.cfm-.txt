Who are we?
Title VI is a driven community of parents, educators, administrators, and community member advocates serving the Shawano School District American Indian populations. The Parent Advisory Committee meets several times throughout the school year to lead the Indian Education initiatives for the year. At this time, the group is focusing on Strategic Planning for upcoming programmatic direction. We want to increase family advocacy and build relationships with the community. The committee is also working on Communications and Outreach and Professional Development.
What is Title VI?
Title VI, Part A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) supports a comprehensive approach to educational improvement and reform for Indian students, helping ensure they benefit from national education reforms and receive every opportunity to achieve to high standards. The programs promote the efforts of schools, local educational agencies, and Indian tribes and organizations to meet the unique educational and culturally related academic needs of their American Indian and Alaska Native students. – U.S. Department of Education, Office of Indian Education
Is my student eligible for Title VI services?
To be eligible for Title VI support services, you will need to submit a 
Federal 506 Form
 to the Shawano School District. You can submit the form to your student’s school or to the main district office building (Attn: Kelley Strike) located at 218 County Road B, Shawano, WI 54166. Call 715-526-3194 with questions. Please read below to determine if your student qualifies for services under Title VI.
Parents/Guardians: Please complete and return this form in order for the Shawano School District to apply for a formula grant, under the Indian Education program. This form is not mandatory or required in any way, however, if it is not completed, the school district cannot count your child for funding under the program. This form will become part of your child’s school record and WILL NOT need to be completed every year.

bands
 terminated since 1940, and those recognized by the State in which the tribe or band reside; or (2) a descendant in the first or second degree (parent or grandparent) as described in (1); or (3) considered by the Secretary of the Interior to be an Indian for any purpose; or (4) an Eskimo or Aleut or other Alaska Native; or (5) a member of an organized Indian group that received a grant under the Indian Education Act of 1988 as it was in effect October 19, 1994.
