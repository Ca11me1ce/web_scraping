SCMS is starting a soccer program for 6th, 7th and 8th grade boys and girls.  This will consist of two coed teams at each level, one for 6th/7th grade and one for 8th grade.  There will be an organizational meeting for students who are interested in playing soccer for SCMS during our back to school open house on August 29, 2017 in the SCMS -LGI at 6:00 pm.  Please plan to attend if interested.  To be part of this program students will need to fill out the standard paperwork for any sport at SCMS, as well as having a physical form filled out and signed by a doctor.  A $10 athletic fee will also be charged to be in soccer.  This fee is charged to all participants of sports at SCMS per sport that they are involved in.  Any questions please contact Mrs. Bartz at 715-526-2594 ext. 3113.
Practice times:   Practices will take place right after school from 2:50-4:30 on the green space between the tennis courts and Olga Brener school.  Games will take place at the Shawano High School soccer field.
