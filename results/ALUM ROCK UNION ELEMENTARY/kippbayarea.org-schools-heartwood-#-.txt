Mission
The mission of KIPP Heartwood Academy is to deepen in the students of East San Jose the knowledge, skills, character, and intellectual habits needed to excel in college and to make positive change every single day.
History
KIPP Heartwood Academy is a public charter middle school in San Jose that is free of charge, open to all students, and focused on preparing young people for college and choice-filled lives. It opened its doors to 73 fifth grade students in July 2004, becoming the first public charter school in Alum Rock. KIPP Heartwood puts students on a solid track to success in high school, college, and the competitive world beyond. Our school derives its name from the redwood tree. The living tissue, or core, of a redwood tree is called the heartwood. When a redwood tree is damaged, it rebuilds itself from its heartwood.

Susana Mena currently is the Principal at KIPP Heartwood Academy. Susi started her career at KIPP as a founding Business Manager in 2004 and moved into the classroom 2 years later. During her 10 years at Heartwood, she has had the opportunity to be part of the administration team and the teaching staff. In November of 2010, she served as interim principal leading a staff during a transitional phase while maintaining a strong team and high student achievement. Susi made the decision to step down as principal in order to go back into the classroom, receive more training in order to one day succeed as school leader. Before her career at KIPP, Susi worked at the YWCA of Silicon Valley as a Program Manager for Youth Programs that serviced schools in the East Side of San Jose, Ca. She received her Bachelor’s degree in Spanish from the University of California, Santa Barbara. Susi grew up in East San Jose, in the same neighborhood her students derive from. She is proud of the fact that she can relate to students and encourage them to succeed, even when the obstacles seem to overshadow the possibilities. As principal, Susi is excited to invest students in their own academic growth, service their community and continue to maintain the tight culture and high expectations that are already in place. In her spare time, Susi enjoys traveling with her family.
