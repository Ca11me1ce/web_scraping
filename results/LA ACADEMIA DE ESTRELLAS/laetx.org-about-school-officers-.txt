Lorraine Mantei (Superintendent)
Lorraine Mantei is a public educator who is committed to the students of Dallas. She taught for 8 years in the Dallas Metropolitan Area in a variety of classroom settings. Her teaching background ranges from a self-contained special education classroom to a departmentalized sixth grade setting.
For nearly fifteen years, Lorraine has worked as an administrator in the North Oak Cliff Area of Dallas, first with Dallas ISD and then as superintendent of La Academia de Estrellas. In addition to her duties in overseeing instruction and teacher supervision, she has worked as the administrator for the LPAC committee, coordinated Campus-Wide Testing, supervised campus Special Education programming, managed campus textbook inventory and developed and implemented campus safety programs.
As the founder of La Academia de Estrellas, Lorraine played a pivotal role through the charter application process. As author of the charter application, she has detailed knowledge of the programs set forth in the charter, giving her a distinct advantage through the start-up phase and as the school has grown. Her wide range of experiences and her expertise make her particularly well suited for the role as the Superintendent of La Academia de Estrellas.

As the school's CFO, Richard manages the school business office, overseeing finance, accounting and human resources.
