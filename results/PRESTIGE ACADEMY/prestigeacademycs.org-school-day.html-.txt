School Day
The school day at Prestige Academy runs from 7:15 a.m. to 2:35 p.m.  After school activities will run from 2:40 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays.  Our school year is extended (August to June).
Our school day consists of three key components called Core, Scholarship Academy, and Enrichment: 
Core: Students take approximately 70 minutes of mathematics and 70 minutes of English every day to ensure they master core skills and content necessary for success in high school and college. Students take 70 minutes of science or 70 minutes of social studies alternating days during the week to to gain core skills in the scientific method, geography and history and to explore questions that relate to their communities as well as the global world.
Scholarship Academy: Students receive targeted tutoring and academic support focused on individual needs throughout the week and two Saturdays per month. 
Enrichment: Students receive formal instruction in art and physical education and also participate in other enrichment activities.
