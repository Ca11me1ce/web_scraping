Over 100 guests crowded the school gym on October 19th to celebrate the dedication of our new building. Friends of the school, donors, elected officials, parents, students and staff participated in this exciting event. Prestige Academy students opened the festivities with a rousing chant, the perfect beginning to a morning filled with energy and enthusiasm.
U.S. Senator Tom Carper delivered the keynote address, praising our progress in raising the academic bar and achievement for Prestige Academy young men. U.S. Congressman Mike Castle also spoke and State Senator Margaret Rose Henry and State Representative Debbie Hudson issued a resolution honoring Prestige Academy students. Parent Derek Gentle and student Joseph Jacklin told us about their personal experiences at Prestige and we also heard from Senior Loan Officer Michael McClary of The Reinvestment Fund, the lending firm who enabled us to purchase the building.
We were also thrilled to announce our new partnership with ING Direct, and Chief Operating Officer Jim Kelly presented a $60,000 donation to the school! We look forward to working closely with ING Direct to develop a mentor program with ING employees and improve financial literacy among our students.
The ribbon cutting dedication was a historic moment in the life of our school, a day filled with promise for Prestige Academy boys.
