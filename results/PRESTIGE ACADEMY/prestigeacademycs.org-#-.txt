I want to take the time to thank all of the parents, teachers and scholars who supported Prestige Academy since its inception. Dr. Jack Perry had a tremendous vision to create a school that would meet the needs for young men in the City of Wilmington. He allowed that vision to come to life and for his vision and committment to the school we salute him. A special thanks to all of the staff for their committment and dedication as well. We appreciate all that you do. Finally, Congratulations to the class of 2017 and all of the scholars. We wish you nothing but the best as you continue to grow and develop as R.E.A.L. men. Best wishes to you all!
​
As a reminder: Parents of 6th and 7th grade scholars, please make sure you enroll your scholars in another school for the 2017-2018 school year. It is important that you make sure your scholar is registered for the upcoming school year.
