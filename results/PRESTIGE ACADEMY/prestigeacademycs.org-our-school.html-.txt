Our School: Overview
Prestige Academy provides a single gender, college preparatory middle school education to some of Delaware's most underserved students. Our objective is to close the achievement gap for our students, open up access to demanding college preparatory high school programs, ensure our young men have the academic skills and personal character needed to take advantage of such access, and set our young men on the road to college success, economic independence, and positive leadership within their community.
We will achieve this objective and address the educational needs of our students through the core characteristics of our academic program: 
All-male environment 
College preparatory curriculum 
Highly structured, disciplined, and respectful school culture 
Character development 
Small School Size
Daily homework support, tutoring and Saturday Support 
Six week interim assessments and data analysis of results to strengthen whole class instruction 
Standards-driven internal assessments that include comprehensive year-end exams in all core subjects 
Parent involvement through the Family Covenant and frequent communication between home and school
