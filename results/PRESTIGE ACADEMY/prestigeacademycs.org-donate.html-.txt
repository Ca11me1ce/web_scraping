Donate - Help Bridge the Gap +
Prestige Academy is a 250 student, all-boys, college preparatory urban charter school, serving grades 5 through 8. It was created to address the concerning and growing achievement gap of low-income boys.
We are proud to say, Prestigeis successfully reversing the trends through the creation of a unique andrigorous academic culture that enables scholars to grow and perform at or abovegrade level by the 8th grade.
Most Prestige students enterthe 5th grade lacking essential skills and academic knowledge.  However, by 8th grade, ourscholars rank among the best in the state in reading and math.  This is in spite of a nearly $3,000 per student funding gap that existsfor charter schools.  PrestigeAcademy Charter School is doing more with less.
We need your support to
