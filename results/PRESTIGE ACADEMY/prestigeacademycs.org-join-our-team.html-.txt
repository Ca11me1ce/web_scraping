Overview
Like all charter schools, Prestige Academy does not charge tuition. We are an option to all families in Wilmington and surrounding communities and are held to high academic standards demonstrated by strong student achievement.
Striving to operate and maintain a successful charter school committed and designed to produce the strongest academic outcomes is an all-encompassing effort that cannot be realized by one individual. It takes the dedication of many like-minded people bonded by the value of quality education and how it can and will change children's lives.
If you are interested in helping to make this vision a reality or know someone else who may, here's how you can help!
