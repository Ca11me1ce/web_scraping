Frequently Asked Questions
	Below are common questions we are asked about our school.
How much is tuition?
There is no tuition! Deming Cesar Chavez Charter High School is a publicly funded charter school.
I've been out of school for a while now. Can you still help me earn my diploma?
We will do our very best to get you your diploma! The most common issue we run into is obtaining your previous records and transcripts, but don't worry. We will do everything we can to obtain your records and get you started towards earning your diploma!
How quickly can I earn my diploma?
Most of our classes are self-paced, open entrance/exit. This means you are able to enroll and get started at anytime and finish at anytime, helping you earn credits more quickly than traditional schools.
I work during the day/have abnormal work hours. Is it possible for me to still earn my diploma?
Absolutely! Many of our classes are offered online and can be completed on your own schedule. Call us today and set up a meeting with our staff to learn more!
