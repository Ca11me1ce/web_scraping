As a national network of non-profit public charter school campuses, Imagine
Schools partners with parents and guardians in the education of their children by providing high quality schools that prepare students for lives of leadership, accomplishment, and exemplary character.
Imagine Schools emphasizes excellence in academics and character, empowering learners to become leaders. Students are equipped to track their own academic progress, using data to set personal learning goals and celebrate achievement. In learning environments rich with rigor and relevancy, students graduate well prepared for college, career, and life.
As an organization, we are proud of the national recognition we have earned for our approach to developing moral, civic and performance character in our students. This culture of strong values extends to our faculty and families, with our Shared Values at the heart of who we want to be.
Three particular values guide our work as an organization: Justice. Integrity. Fun. These 
Shared Values
, along with our 
Measures of Excellence
, ensure that every Imagine campus is built upon expectations high enough to live up to each child’s potential.
Our public charter school campuses reflect the strengths and diversity of the communities in which we are privileged to serve. Each day, more than 32,000 K-12 students enter the doors of one of our 56 campuses in eight states and the District of Columbia. We invite you to learn more and find your place within
