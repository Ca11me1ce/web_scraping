Enrollment Application
By enrolling your child at an Imagine Schools, you create the foundation for a lifetime of success. Our unique approach to education combines personal attention, inspirational teaching, a proprietary integrated curriculum and technologically advanced instruction in a small class setting. Again and again, parents tell us that our schools have done more for their children than they had ever imagined was possible.
Because class sizes are limited, we encourage you to enroll today.
Our Enrollment Process 
To begin the enrollment process, you will need to submit a pre-enrollment form. After we receive your pre-enrollment form, we will notify you with in 5 business days to confirm that we have received this information. (see below for pre-enrollment application).
Lottery Process: A lottery date is established prior to the first day of school. On that date, the number of enrolled and pre-enrolled students in each grade is compared with the available seats. If there are more applicants than available space, a lottery process will be used to determine randomly which of the pre-enrolled students will be admitted. The remaining applicants will be placed on a waiting list. For grades that are not over-subscribed, enrollments will be accepted on a first-come first-served basis.
Once accepted, a student need not re-apply annually; he or she will be enrolled for all subsequent grades in that school.
Imagine Schools admits students of any race, religion, color, gender, physical handicap, national or ethnic origin to all rights, privileges, programs, and activities made available at our schools. Preference is given to siblings of enrolled students and children of Imagine Schools’ employees.
