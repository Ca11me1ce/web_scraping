Dolphin Athletics
Participation in team and individual sports not only promotes a feeling of family and belonging, but it allows students to develop themselves physically and emotionally. Students gain strength and skills and have the opportunity to develop leadership skills while learning the art of good sportsmanship and fair play.
At Putnam Academy, all students participate in physical education classes. They also have the opportunity to join in our extracurricular activities.
