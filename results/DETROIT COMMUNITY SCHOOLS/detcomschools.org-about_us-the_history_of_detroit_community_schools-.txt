DCS History
DetroitCommunity Schools, A Public School Academy operates as a non-profitcorporation and a governmental agency of the State of Michigan. DCS provides publiceducation for grades Kindergarten thru twelve.  As a Michigan “charterschool”, DCS does not charge tuition and is subject to the same teachercertification and other requirements as any other public school in theState of Michigan.
Mr. Bart Eddy and Ms.Candyce Sweda developed the concept for DCS and wrote the charterapplication.  The charter to operate a K-12 school was granted by SVSUon May 19, 1997. Detroit Community High School opened its doors inAugust of that same year. DCHS began operations in a rented elementaryschool building on Grandville Avenue in Detroit. With the dream of oneday being a K-12 district, DCHS initially enrolled 21 kindergarteners,sixty 9th graders, and nineteen 10th graders.  Two years later, thefirst group of 20 seniors matriculated.  In 2001 a decision was made toclose the Kindergarten and to concentrate on secondary education. However, the dream of a K–12 district remained. 
The needs of thegrowing school quickly exceeded the capacity of the leased facility. In 2005 the Board of Directors secured financing for the purchase andrenovation of a 120,000 square foot former industrial facility, locatedon nine acres, on Burt Road in Detroit.  The current DCS campus featuresa state of the art High School, modern modular buildings which housethe elementary school, beautiful grounds and room for expansion.
Asignificant development in our history occurred when the Board wasapproached by SVSU in the summer of 2005 and asked to consider taking ona K-5 elementary operation that another public school academy was goingto close.  While the challenges associated with this were significant,the opportunity to realize a dream deferred was too great to ignore.  InAugust of 2005 Detroit Community Elementary School began operation inOak Park Michigan in a rented facility.  The following year DCES movedto the Burt Rd. campus. 
Detroit Community Schools presentlyconsists of a high school and an elementary/middle school, and servesapproximately one thousand students in grades Kindergarten throughTwelve
DETROIT, MI 
–In December 2013, after repeated one-year re-authorizations, the DCS Board of Directorsdirected staff to pursue other authorizer options. After responding to a Bay Mills RFP, DCS BoardMembers and staff were invited to make a presentation to at Bay Mills Community College atthe end of May 2014.
On June 27, 2014, the Bay Mills Community College Board of Regents approved a five (5) yearcharter school contract with Detroit Community Schools. Saginaw Valley State University (SVSU)had been DCS’ authorizer since its inception in 1997.
