About the Murals
Alongwith Johannes Matthiessen, our guest artist from Germany, DCHS studentshave created these masterful wall murals in the interior villageclassroom space.
Designed after the traditional house paintingsof the West African culture, these beautiful decorated walls with theirdeep, rich color are an expression of the artistic bridge between theCreator Spirit and everyday village life.  In the Ghanaian village whereJohannes worked in February 2007, the village King, Nana Kwahin, gavehis voice to the world view of his culture when he said: "The greatestliving artist is the Creator God who created all living beings on thisearth and in the heavens.  We, too, are creators who are here tocontinue the work and transform it into a future piece of art.  That is our task."
Hereat DCHS, our students have been building the cultural bridge throughartwork.  What has begun to emerge is a sense for the Global Communitywhereby the interior classroom walls reflect the village and theAncestors, while the exterior classrooms on the perimeter, with their"street lights', decpict the city.
