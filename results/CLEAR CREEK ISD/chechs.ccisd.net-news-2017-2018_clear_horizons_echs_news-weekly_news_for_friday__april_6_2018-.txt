STAAR: STAAR testing begins next week!  Students in English I will participate in the STAAR EOC assessment Tuesday, April 10, and students in English II will participate in the STAAR EOC assessment Thursday, April 12.  
The English EOC assessment is a five hour exam.  Testing will be paused mid-way through the testing time to allow students to have a lunch break.  Students may bring a lunch or purchase one from the CCISD lunch line.  
Students bringing a lunch should make plans to bring items that do not require a microwave, as one will not be available during testing.  
Students will not be allowed to wear a smart watch during testing.  Therefore, students who regularly wear smart watches during the day may want to leave these items at home, as they will not be allowed in the testing environment.
STAAR US History EOC:  Juniors, you will be participating in the US History STAAR EOC assessment Wednesday, May 9!  We’ve gathered several resources you can utilize as review tools in preparation for your STAAR assessment.  You can access these resources on our campus website under the 
“
For Students”
 tab or under the 
“
For Parents”
 tab.

Advisory:
 Every day students will report to Advisory class by 8:00 AM.  Advisory is a critical class for students each day as we disseminate crucial information and touch base with every student.  Seniors meet in the BQR and all other students will meet in the classroom stated on their schedules.  Students will see their names and Advisory locations posted in the main hallways on the first day of school.
Dress Code:
  Clear Horizons follows the CCISD dress code.  The student dress code can be found on our website under the “For Parents” tab or the “For Students” tab.

Late Bus:  Clear Horizons provides a late bus that runs every Tuesday and Thursday at 4:45 PM.  The late bus will be in front of our school by 4:45 p.m. each Tuesday and Thursday and typically departs within 10 minutes. The late bus will drop off in two locations: The East side of 45 at Clear Creek High School and on the West side of 45 at Brookside Intermediate. Students who are planning on riding the late bus must request a pass from the office. The request must be made for official business only (ie tutorials, a rehearsal, detention, etc.). A bus pass must be picked up before 1:00 p.m. on the day you want to ride (Tuesday or Thursday). No bus passes will be issued after lunch.  
If you do not have a pass you will not be allowed to ride the bus.  If no one has picked up a late bus pass, the bus will be cancelled. Students, make sure that your parent/guardian knows that you are staying late and catching the late bus. The front office closes at 3:30p.m.  When signing up for pass students must include the following:
1) Purpose – Why are you staying late?
2) Location from 3:30 – 5:00 – Where will you be?
3) Parent Permission – Did you let your parent know you were staying late?
The reason we must have this information is so that we can find you in case of an emergency.
Driving your own vehicle to school?  All students who drive and park on campus must register with SJC for a parking permit.  Beginning this school year, all students who drive to school must also register their vehicles with the Clear Horizons office.  Please stop by the office to get a copy of the Clear Horizons Parking Regulations and a Clear Horizons Vehicle Registration Form.
