Service Learning:
  The absolute final due date for all Service Learning hours to be submitted is:
March 29
 – All Service Learning Hours (at least 20 hours) must be turned in by this date.
As service learning is a key aspect of our mission at Clear Horizons, students who do not meet the 20 hour requirement will meet with Clear Horizons administration to explain the deficit.  Students who refuse to meet the requirement will be returned to their zoned campus.
Late Bus:  Clear Horizons provides a late bus that runs every Tuesday and Thursday at 4:45 PM.  The late bus will be in front of our school by 4:45 p.m. each Tuesday and Thursday and typically departs within 10 minutes. The late bus will drop off in two locations: The East side of 45 at Clear Creek High School and on the West side of 45 at Brookside Intermediate. Students who are planning on riding the late bus must request a pass from the office. The request must be made for official business only (ie tutorials, a rehearsal, detention, etc.). A bus pass must be picked up before 1:00 p.m. on the day you want to ride (Tuesday or Thursday). No bus passes will be issued after lunch.  
If you do not have a pass you will not be allowed to ride the bus.  If no one has picked up a late bus pass, the bus will be cancelled. Students, make sure that your parent/guardian knows that you are staying late and catching the late bus. The front office closes at 3:30p.m.  When signing up for pass students must include the following:
1) Purpose – Why are you staying late?
2) Location from 3:30 – 5:00 – Where will you be?
3) Parent Permission – Did you let your parent know you were staying late?
The reason we must have this information is so that we can find you in case of an emergency.
Intermediate and High School Campuses:  All Clear Horizons students have been informed of their appropriate locations while waiting for a bus at other campuses.  Students who do not wait in the appropriate areas will lose the privilege of riding the shuttles to or from the schools in question.  Clear Horizons students are not permitted to roam the halls at other campuses and must remain in the appropriate locations.  As a reminder, the locations have been listed below:
