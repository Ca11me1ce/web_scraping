STAAR EOC testing:  STAAR Testing will occur in May on the following dates: 
Tuesday, May 8          Algebra I
Wednesday, May 9     US History
Thursday, May 10       Biology
Students whose college finals conflict with a STAAR test date must notify their professors of the conflict.  Students are required to report for STAAR testing, as it is a state-required graduation credit.  Professors will be notified via Dual Credit of the potential conflict and will offer students an alternate exam time to make up the college exam.  
Should a professor’s alternate exam time conflict with a student’s Clear Horizons class schedule, the student will perform the following steps: 
The student will email his/her professor and receive written confirmation of the day/time of the alternate exam.
The student will print out this email and provide a copy of it to Ms. Kenworthy 
on the day of the alternate exam.
Ms. Kenworthy will excuse the student’s absences, documenting the alternate exam time in the student’s attendance.
Any student who reports to an exam without providing written documentation from the professor and speaking to Ms. Kenworthy 
the day of the alternate exam, may be addressed for truancy.
STAAR US History EOC:  Juniors, you will be participating in the US History STAAR EOC assessment Wednesday, May 9!  We’ve gathered several resources you can utilize as review tools in preparation for your STAAR assessment.  You can access these resources on our campus website under the 
“
For Students”
 tab or under the 
“
For Parents”
 tab.

Booster Club:  There is still time to join the Booster Club!!  Just go to 
http://chechs.ccisd.net/booster_club/booster_club
 and select the membership form.  Complete and return the form to the office with the membership dues and you are in!  Students ages 16 and older are also able to join the Booster Club!  Each family membership and each individual student membership gives the student a chance at the Booster Club Scholarship at the end of his or her senior year!!
Advisory:
 Every day students will report to Advisory class by 8:00 AM.  Advisory is a critical class for students each day as we disseminate crucial information and touch base with every student.  Seniors meet in the BQR and all other students will meet in the classroom stated on their schedules.  Students will see their names and Advisory locations posted in the main hallways on the first day of school.
Dress Code:
  Clear Horizons follows the CCISD dress code.  The student dress code can be found on our website under the “For Parents” tab or the “For Students” tab.  
http://chechs.ccisd.net/UserFiles/Servers/Server_655841/File/Dress%20Code%202016%202017.pdf
Late Bus:  Clear Horizons provides a late bus that runs every Tuesday and Thursday at 4:45 PM.  The late bus will be in front of our school by 4:45 p.m. each Tuesday and Thursday and typically departs within 10 minutes. The late bus will drop off in two locations: The East side of 45 at Clear Creek High School and on the West side of 45 at Brookside Intermediate. Students who are planning on riding the late bus must request a pass from the office. The request must be made for official business only (ie tutorials, a rehearsal, detention, etc.). A bus pass must be picked up before 1:00 p.m. on the day you want to ride (Tuesday or Thursday). No bus passes will be issued after lunch.  
If you do not have a pass you will not be allowed to ride the bus.  If no one has picked up a late bus pass, the bus will be cancelled. Students, make sure that your parent/guardian knows that you are staying late and catching the late bus. The front office closes at 3:30p.m.  When signing up for pass students must include the following:
1) Purpose – Why are you staying late?
2) Location from 3:30 – 5:00 – Where will you be?
3) Parent Permission – Did you let your parent know you were staying late?
The reason we must have this information is so that we can find you in case of an emergency.
Driving your own vehicle to school?  All students who drive and park on campus must register with SJC for a parking permit.  Beginning this school year, all students who drive to school must also register their vehicles with the Clear Horizons office.  Please stop by the office to get a copy of the Clear Horizons Parking Regulations and a Clear Horizons Vehicle Registration Form.
