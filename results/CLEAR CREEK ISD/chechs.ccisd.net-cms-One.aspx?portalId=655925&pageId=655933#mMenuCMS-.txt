About Us
Clear Horizons Early College High School was established in 2007 on the campus of San Jacinto College South on Beamer Road and has continually earned TEA’s highest rating.  Students graduate each year with an Associate’s Degree from San Jacinto College three weeks before walking across the stage and receiving a high school diploma from CCISD.
Early college high school is a bold approach based on the principle that academic rigor, combined with the opportunity to save time and money, is a powerful motivator for students to work hard and meet serious intellectual challenges. Early College High Schools are designed so that low-income youth, first-generation college goers, English language learners, students of color, and other young people who are traditionally underrepresented in higher education can simultaneously earn a high school diploma and an associate degree or up to two years of credit toward a bachelor’s degree—tuition free.  The majority of the students at Clear Horizons meet one of the four target population criterion defined for Early College High Schools (ECHS) by the Texas Education Agency (TEA):  1) students are first generation college goers, 2) students are from minority groups traditionally underrepresented on college campuses, 3) students are economically disadvantaged, and/or 4) students meet one of the thirteen Texas at-risk indicators. 
Clear Horizons Early College High School is a CCISD open enrollment charter school serving approximately 400 students, 100 per grade level.  As defined by TEA, an ECHS may only service about 100 students per grade level.  
Eighth-grade students in CCISD may apply each spring to participate in the lottery selection for 125 seats in the freshman class.  All coursework is at the Pre-Advanced Placement and Advanced Placement levels. In addition to regular degree coursework, service learning projects are required annually and internships are required in the junior and senior years.
CCISD Core Values:
Trustworthiness – Act with honesty in all that you do
Respect – Value yourself and others
Responsibility – Own your choices
Fairness – Play by the rules and consider the needs of others
Caring – Be kind to others
Citizenship – Work to improve your school, community, and country
