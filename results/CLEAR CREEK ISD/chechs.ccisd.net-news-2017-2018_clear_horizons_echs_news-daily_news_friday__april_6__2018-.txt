STAAR: STAAR testing begins next week!  Students in English I will participate in the STAAR EOC assessment Tuesday, April 10, and students in English II will participate in the STAAR EOC assessment Thursday, April 12.  
The English EOC assessment is a five hour exam.  Testing will be paused mid-way through the testing time to allow students to have a lunch break.  Students may bring a lunch or purchase one from the CCISD lunch line.  
Students bringing a lunch should make plans to bring items that do not require a microwave, as one will not be available during testing.  
Students will not be allowed to wear a smart watch during testing.  Therefore, students who regularly wear smart watches during the day may want to leave these items at home, as they will not be allowed in the testing environment.
Yearbooks:  Yearbooks are on sale now!  Order online at balfour.com or pay cash/check PAYABLE to CHECHS to Mrs. Hampton in 9.268.  Price is $35 until April 30.  From May 1st until books sell out, books cost $40.  Order yours today!

We will have sessions discussing grades 10, 11 and 12 at Horizons and what to expect for the coming year.  We will also have representatives from The University of Texas and the University of Houston-Clear Lake!  You don’t want to miss it!!
SJC Anatomy & Physiology Student Poster Symposium:  
  The SJC Biology Department is hosting a student poster symposium Monday, April 16, from 9:30 a.m. – 12:30 p.m. and Tuesday, April 17, from 9:30 a.m. – 3:30 p.m. in the S-1 Atrium (the Science Building).  Students may not miss high school or college class to attend SJC events.

 tab.  
Brookwood Senior Reunion:
  Brookwood Elementary School is hosting its Senior Reunion Friday, May 18, at 2:45 p.m.  If you went to Brookwood Elementary and are now a senior, they would love to see you!!
Do You Write?:
  Journalism Club is looking for short stories, poems, essays, and memoirs to publish in their newsletter. If you have written something this year you would like to submit for consideration, please email a typed copy to 
horizons.journalism@gmail.com
Closed Campus: Clear Horizons ECHS is a closed campus, as are all CCISD campuses.  Because we are a closed campus, all visitors must satisfy the following requirements:
All visitors must check in at the front office and receive a visitors badge
All visitors must be here for official school business 
No person is to be in Clear Horizons areas or with Clear Horizons students unless they have been through the proper channels.  Students MAY NOT invite friends from other schools or acquaintances they have met socially to visit our school, regardless of our location on a college campus.  Persons caught on campus who do not have official business with SJC or Clear Horizons will be reported to the police.  
5 Places:  Students who have a cancelled college class or an open period may be in the following places on campus when not in class:
Building 9 in a classroom with a teacher
The Student Center
The Library
The ILC
The Green Space between the 4 buildings
Students may not be in any other area (including building 7 or 8) when not in class.  The safety of our students is our utmost concern; therefore, these 5 monitored areas are the only areas students (regardless of grade level) may be when not in class.
Printer Room Paper:  Students must supply their own paper to the printer room. Paper may be purchased for $.01 per sheet (a penny per page) at the front desk in the main office.
Clear Horizons Shirts:  We still have Clear Horizons Coyote shirts available for purchase in the front office.  Short sleeve and women’s V-neck shirts are $15, long sleeve shirts are $20.  Buy yours today while supplies last!
Late Bus:  Clear Horizons provides a late bus that runs every Tuesday and Thursday at 4:45 PM.  The late bus will be in front of our school by 4:45 p.m. each Tuesday and Thursday and typically departs within 10 minutes. The late bus will drop off in two locations: The East side of 45 at Clear Creek High School and on the West side of 45 at Brookside Intermediate. Students who are planning on riding the late bus must request a pass from the office. The request must be made for official business only (ie tutorials, a rehearsal, detention, etc.). A bus pass must be picked up before 1:00 p.m. on the day you want to ride (Tuesday or Thursday). No bus passes will be issued after lunch.  
If you do not have a pass you will not be allowed to ride the bus.  If no one has picked up a late bus pass, the bus will be cancelled. Students, make sure that your parent/guardian knows that you are staying late and catching the late bus. The front office closes at 3:30p.m.  When signing up for pass students must include the following:
1) Purpose – Why are you staying late?
2) Location from 3:30 – 5:00 – Where will you be?
3) Parent Permission – Did you let your parent know you were staying late?
The reason we must have this information is so that we can find you in case of an emergency.
Intermediate and High School Campuses:  All Clear Horizons
 students have been informed of their appropriate locations while waiting for a bus at other campuses.  Students who do not wait in the appropriate areas will lose the privilege of riding the shuttles to or from the schools in question.  Clear Horizons students are not permitted to roam the halls at other campuses and must remain in the appropriate locations.  As a reminder, the locations have been listed below:
Bayside – Covered Exterior Patio at Bus Ramp
