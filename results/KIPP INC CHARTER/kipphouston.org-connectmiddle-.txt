	The growing KIPP CONNECT Middle School is an integral component of the new PreK through 12th-grade KIPP school with wrap-around services modeled after Purpose Built Communities in Atlanta. The vision is to encourage educational excellence, character responsibility, and balanced growth to ensure our students will discover and develop their talents and fulfill their potential to succeed in college and the world beyond. Our students are empowered to take ownership of their path to and through college as pilots, not passengers, of their journey, and ultimately grow into successful community members.
      About    
	KIPP CONNECT Middle School serves 433 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th graders from Houston’s Sharpstown and Gulfton neighborhoods.
	Students will have a 1:1 ratio with technology in order to make the greatest gains in academics.
	B.E.A.T., our school values, are actively taught to our students:
	• Brain Growth is demonstrated through optimism and curiosity.
	• Endurance with Excellence and Energy is shown through grit and zest.
	• Appreciation is exhibited through gratitude and self-control.
	• Together is expressed through social intelligence and love.
	Teaching at KIPP CONNECT MS
	KIPP’s newest middle school is a place where all staff members live out the values as well – with a huge focus on brain growth. All of our staff members continually grow, learn, and develop in their fields as they push to reach their aspirations. Especially
	in the next four years, all staff members are helping create the foundation of the school, both academically and culturally, which is a legacy that will last beyond any individual in the building.
