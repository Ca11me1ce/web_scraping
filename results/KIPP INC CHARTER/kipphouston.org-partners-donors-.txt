	About
	Founded in Houston in 1994, the Knowledge Is Power Program (KIPP) is committed to providing low-income students with a college-preparatory education that prepares them to succeed in college and in life. Nationally, there are 209 KIPP schools serving nearly 90,000 students. In Houston, there are 14,500 KIPP students enrolled in 28 KIPP schools. More than 90% of KIPPsters are from low-income households, and nearly 90% of our 8th graders have matriculated to college. Our students are more than 5 times as likely to complete college as their low-income peers across Harris County (nearly 50% vs. 10%), and we continue to improve our college success rates. 
	FAQs
	How will KIPP achieve its goals?
	By implementing our strategic growth plan (will be in donate section to link to) and multiplying our direct and indirect impact throughout the local education system, KIPP Houston will equip thousands of low-income students with the character and academic skills they need to succeed in college. 
	How is KIPP funded?
	Charter schools receive state funds based on the average daily attendance of students (same as traditional public schools); however, they do not receive funds from local tax revenue and the majority, including Texas charters, do not receive state facilities funding. A recent independent analysis of revenue differences between charter school districts and traditional independent school districts reveals that there is a $1,000 gap per student. (Foundation School Program, 5-year average).
	What can I give?
		Cash	
		Securities, real estate, tangible personal property, and closely held stock	
		Life insurance, retirement plan assets, savings bonds, and life insurance death benefits
