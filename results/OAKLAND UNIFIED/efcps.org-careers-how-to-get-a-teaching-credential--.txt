How to Get a Teaching Credential
How to Get a Teaching Credential
There are a wide variety of teacher credential programs to meet a variety of schedule and financial needs. 
Here
 is a summary of the programs that attended our December 2016 Teacher Credential Program Info Fair. In some instances, you can teach for a limited time without going through an internship credential program. Please see below for details.
There are some teaching positions in charter schools that do not require a teaching credential (PE, Engineering, Design, Technology, Visual Arts, Music). However, enrollment in a credential program will teach participants key strategies for classroom management, lesson design, and learning theory. Therefore, we highly encourage all our teachers to pursue a credential.
Credential programs can be in class, online, or hybrid and are typically 1 – 2 years in length. The most common types of programs are:
Traditional
Residency
Internship
Participants in traditional programs are enrolled in classes while simultaneously completing an unpaid student teaching assignment.
Participants gain experience through student teaching placements with a Mentor Teacher in at least 2 different public schools.
Participants in residency programs are enrolled in classes while simultaneously working as a paid part-time resident teacher under the guidance of a mentor teacher of record.
EFC residents’ work schedules are designed to accommodate credential program classes and requirements.
EFC residents receive support from a full-time credentialed mentor teacher, as well as their credential program supervisor.
Participants in intern programs are enrolled in classes while simultaneously working as the paid teacher of record in a public school.
In-person and online intern program classes take place on evenings and weekends in order to accommodate the work schedule of the full-time teacher.
EFC interns receive support from a full-time induction coach, as well as their credential program supervisor.
