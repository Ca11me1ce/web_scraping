Innovation Mindset
Education for Change Public Schools is dedicated to providing our students with a 21st century education that will prepare them for success in college and in life.   Paramount in this goal is supporting innovation and iteration in our schools to rethink what a 21st Century Education looks like.   At EFC, we pride ourselves in encouraging a culture of inquiry and improvement.  Since 2012,  we have focused on leveraging technology to personalize student learning and building student capacity to lead and manage their own learning.
Supporting Blended Learning at Epic!
After learning from pilots in multiple schools, we have implemented personalized learning organization-wide, incorporating best practices learned along the way.  At Epic, we introduced student dashboards to encourage students to take ownership of their own learning.  At ASCEND, we are iterating on multiage classrooms to facilitate maximum agility to address student needs.  EFC is also a Google Apps for Education network, and is supportive of teachers who want to become Google Certified and really integrate next generation technology into their instruction.
