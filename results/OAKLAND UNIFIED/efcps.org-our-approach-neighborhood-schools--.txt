Neighborhood Schools
Education for Change was founded in 2005 in partnership with the Oakland Unified School District to leverage charter flexibility to turnaround persistently underperforming OUSD elementary schools.  Education for Change started first with Cox Academy (formerly E. Morris Cox) and Achieve Academy (formerly Hawthorne Elementary).  In 2012, based on the demand of local families and educators, Education for Change welcomed three new neighborhood schools into our family (ASCEND, Lazear, and Learning Without Limits).  In 2015, Education for Change created Epic Middle School to meet the demand for a neighborhood middle school. We’ve grown together over the past years, sharing best practices, leveraging talent and resources and improving outcomes across all of our school campuses!
Learning Without Limits principal Leo Fuchs addresses the Oakland School board as EFC’s Chief Talent Officer and former ASCEND princial Larissa Adam looks on. Together, both schools proactively converted to charters and became part of Education for Change community!
