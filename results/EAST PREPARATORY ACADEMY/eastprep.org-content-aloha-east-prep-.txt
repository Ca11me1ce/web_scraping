Aloha from East Prep!
What a wonderful word to have in one's vocabulary!  It means "hello" AND "goodbye" AND "love" all in one simple 3 syllable expression!  As we take a break from NorthEast Ohio's lovely Spring weather, and host a Hawaiian themed dance, we say hello to testing season and the last months of school.  Kinders and First Grade learn a little hula and show us the "Pearly Shells" of a far off paradise even as they bring smiles and joy to kids in Cleveland of all ages beyond their years.  Thus, there's always something new to say "hello" to, say "goodbye" to others and hopefully foster a "love" for learning right in the midst of everything!
