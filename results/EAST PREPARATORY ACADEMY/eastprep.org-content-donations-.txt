Donations
We are a tuition-free, public school that is open to all students. Our students have dreams and aspirations of college and career and are looking for a great beginning to their educational journey. We pride ourselves on working with students who are well-behaved and focused on their future.
As with most dreams, they are successful with a combination of personal drive and support from others. On behalf of our students, we are always happy to accept donations of almost any kind, because they can be used to further a child’s dream. Some examples of donations that we find most useful are:
Basic School Supplies such as pencils, crayons, markers, glue, scissors
Art Supplies – posterboard, construction paper, traceable letters
Uniform Clothing – burgundy shirts, tan pants, all black shoes
Winter Accessories – hats, gloves, scarves, warm socks
For donations, interested parties can contact Ms. Beasley or their child's classroom teachers at the school (216) 539-0595.
