Academic FAQ
Academic Information
What classes does iSucceed offer?
Our highly structured and 
engaging curriculum includes all the core academic subjects
—math, English, social studies and science—and some electives to prepare students for graduation. We utilize a variety of nationally-renowned textbook and media providers, and we encompass all learning styles.
Will I get a diploma through iSucceed?
All our classes are fully aligned with Idaho state standards, and you will graduate with a fully-accredited Idaho high school diploma.
How do I interact with my teachers?
Your teachers will communicate with you every week through phone calls, email, blogs and discussion boards. Students are also encouraged to reach out to teachers during office hours for assistance in courses. Many students report that they communicate more here than they ever did with their teachers in a traditional school.
I don't have a computer or laptop. Will I receive one?
Students who do not have access to a personal laptop or computer may request a loaned Google Chromebook. During the enrollment process, students can inform their enrollment advisor that a laptop is needed, and the enrollment advisor will work with each student to complete the required paperwork. The laptop is for school purposes and must be returned to the school at the time of withdrawal or graduation. Failure to return the laptop will result in a fee up to $250.00
How is attendance determined?
Students are required to complete 10 lessons each week. iSucceed advises that students create and stick with a weekly study schedule to ensure that these work requirements are met.
Can I drop or change a course?
It depends. Please discuss this with your guidance counselor, who will be able to guide you through the process.
Can I be enrolled dually at another high school?
All dual enrollment requests must be approved by the iSucceed Guidance Counselor. If you are interested in dual enrollment, please contact the school to discuss your situation.
How many credits are required for graduation?
A minimum of 46 credits is required by the State of Idaho, broken down by various subjects to earn your high school diploma. Currently, this is the model followed by iSucceed Virtual high school.
How many credits does each class give me?
Each course passed is worth one credit.
How many courses will I take at a time?
In most cases, new students are assigned three courses.
When I complete my course, can I add more?
You can only add courses if it’s before the add/drop date for each 9-week block.
Is all iSucceed curriculum online?
Yes. All course curriculum, hyperlinks, resources, etc. are online and accessed when courses are launched within the Student/Parent Portal. Depending on the class, you may have some offline work required as all.
Does iSucceed offer summer classes?
iSucceed does not currently offer summer classes. If this changes, we will inform all existing students/parents as well as update our 
enrollment schedule
.
How do I order transcripts?
Transcripts are not automatically provided to students. 
You can request your transcripts here.
Parent Information
Do your teachers meet the same requirements as traditional school teachers?
Yes, all of our instructional staff are highly-qualified, certified teachers and meet all state requirements.
How do you work with students who have special needs?
iSucceed’s special education department provides individualized attention and support to special needs. A teacher/caseworker is assigned to each student from the time of enrollment and throughout all courses.
Is iSucceed Accredited?
Yes, we are accredited with AdvancED. iSucceed Virtual High School has been accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools (NCA) since its inception, and is recognized by the Idaho Public School Charter Commission. This means that an iSucceed diploma is recognized by colleges, universities and employers, and is as valuable a degree from any Idaho high school.
How will I be able to check in on my student’s grades?
Parents and guardians are able to log into the Student/Parent Portal, which allows parents and guardians to be as involved as necessary in their student’s academics. Through the Student/Parent Portal, parents and guardians can see grades, interactions with teachers, course announcements, missing assignments and easily determine if their student is on track or falling behind.
