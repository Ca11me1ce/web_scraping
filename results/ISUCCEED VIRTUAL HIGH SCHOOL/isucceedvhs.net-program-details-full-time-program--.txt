Student Life & Clubs
Events, clubs and social activities are an important part of your high school experience. At iSucceed, we work hard to provide these elements for students who enjoy the social experience and don’t want to lose that when starting an online school. We promote regional in-person events throughout the year for both academic help and social interaction. Students also enjoy a shared online space with students and faculty with a school newspaper, years and participate in discussion. Participation is always optional, but encouraged!
