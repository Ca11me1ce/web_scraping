Learn More
Our certified, highly-qualified instructors believe in providing personal support to our students. They provide one-on-one attention, and keep constant communication with their students through phone calls, emails and online tutoring sessions. Most students at iSucceed find that they communicate more with their instructors at iSucceed than in a traditional school.
iSucceed offers a rigorous curriculum with a robust choice of classes aligned to state and national standards. All coursework is completed online via a variety of interactive technology. Our curriculum is designed to serve a wide range of students with such courses as foundation, core, credit recovery, and honors. We also offer a broad array of electives to enhance each student’s educational experience and to promote the learning of real-world skills.
Our Mission
iSucceed Virtual High School’s mission is to provide individualized and supportive, quality educational opportunities, inspiring diverse students to succeed.
We provide a personalized, flexible, innovative, student-led/instructor-facilitated and supervised learning program, where high-school-aged students can study at their own pace, on their own schedule with instruction, supervision, and support from a team of highly-qualified, Idaho-certified instructors.
We also will provide a broad selection of online courses aligned to Idaho state standards, while supplying each student who requests one with a school laptop.
Our Vision
Every student deserves an opportunity to excel, “an honest and real chance to reach their potential.”
Our vision is to enable individual students to acquire the necessary life skills that will equip them for later stages in life, and to optimize learning for each student so that they can achieve their individual learning objectives. This requires an understanding of each student and his/her profile and designing a high-quality, relevant program that gives these students the best possible opportunity for academic success.
The application of technology has made the personalization of education possible. Although full-time online school is not appropriate for every student, for many, iSucceed Virtual High School can be the bridge that brings them back into the public school system or enables them to graduate by:
Allowing students to advance at their own pace
Providing schedule flexibility to accommodate work or family care responsibilities
Enabling freedom of location, for those who have physical challenges
Providing connections in a one-to-one setting with certified instructors and mentors, for those who need more personalized attention
iSucceed Virtual High School provides an excellent educational alternative for high-school-age students, throughout the State of Idaho, who for a variety of reasons, do not attend brick and mortar high schools, or who may benefit from a non-traditional school setting.
Available to all 9–12th grade students in Idaho, iSucceed Virtual High is the ideal solution for all students seeking an alternative academic setting, no matter what their specific life circumstances may be.
iSucceed Virtual High School is accredited by AdvanceEd and authorized by the Idaho Public School Charter Commision.
Our History
In 2008, a group of caring, concerned parents and community members came together to found iSucceed Virtual High School, Inc., as an Idaho nonprofit corporation. They had a vision to create opportunities that would enable all Idaho students to achieve a high school diploma online, including under-served, minority, and at-risk high school-aged students situated throughout the state of Idaho.
Since then, a diverse group of talented high school students have walked away with an accredited diploma in hand each year, each with his or her own unique success story.
iSucceed Virtual High School has been accredited by AdvanceEd (previously known as the Northwest Accreditation Commision) since its inception. iSucceed is authorized by the Idaho Public School Charter Commission, and provides several opportunities for students to receive their high school diploma online. From credit recovery programs to accelerated programs, we believe in helping every student receive the support they need to achieve success.
