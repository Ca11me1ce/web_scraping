Special Education
iSucceed works hard to provide a robust Special Education system for students with disabilities who are in need of specialized instruction.
iSucceed offers Individualized Education Plans (IEPs) for students with specialized needs. Our Special Education (SPED) staff work with students online and in-person and are dedicated to each student’s success. The Special Education teachers accommodate classes, provide extra one-on-one assistance and make individualized accommodations/modifications/adaptations based on each students unique needs.
iSucceed’s Special Education policies and procedures have been developed to comply with all applicable federal and state statutes and regulations:
Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)
IDEA implementing regulations
Idaho State Statutes
Idaho Administrative Codes
Child Find
Child Find is a component of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 2004 that requires states to locate, identify, and evaluate all children with disabilities, ages birth through 21 years, who are in need of early intervention or special education services. This includes children who are highly mobile, such as migrant or homeless children, children suspected of having a disability even though they are advancing from grade to grade as well as private school students and homeschool students.
According to IDEA eligibility requirement of 20 U.S.C. Section 1412 The Idaho State Department of Education is the lead agency for early childhood special education services for children age three (3) to five (5) with disabilities under Part B of IDEA. The law requires the lead agency to carry out Child Find activities for children ages three (3) to twenty-one (21). As lead agency for Part C of IDEA, the Department of Health and Welfare has the primary responsibility for Child Find activities for children ages birth to three (3). Birth to three (3) Child Find activities are ongoing and whenever possible, coordinated with local school districts during their scheduled Child Find activities.
The Infant Toddler Program identifies designated regional personnel to coordinate Child Find activities in each area of the state. Each regional program and the Regional Early Childhood Committee (RECC) has a system to locate, identify, screen, monitor, and refer infants and toddlers who may be in need of early intervention services.
2-1-1 Idaho CareLine (Idaho Infant Toddler Program’s Central Directory)
A statewide, toll free telephone service established for providing information and referral for numerous service needs, including prenatal care, health services, child care, and early intervention services, in which callers are connected to appropriate resources serving their geographic area. Written information is available upon request. The 2-1-1 Idaho CareLine is available to the general public and can be accessed by dialing 2-1-1 or 1-800-926-2588.
Academic Screening
To support the learning of all students and to further assist students with unique learning differences, your child’s development and academic progress will be screened at the request of the parent. A screening is completed within 45 calendar days of your student’s enrollment at iSucceed. When a concern is identified through screening procedures, you will be notified within 10 school days and informed of procedures to follow up on your child’s needs.
Screening: An informal, although organized process, of identifying students who are not meeting or who may not be meeting Idaho Content Standards or Idaho Core Standards.
Referral to Consider a Special Education Evaluation: After a team reviews information about progress to general education interventions with little or no progress, a student may be referred to Special Education to consider a special education evaluation. Once given consent iSucceed has 60 calendar days to complete the evaluations and determine eligibility.
Re-evaluations happen every three years unless the team determines new assessments are needed before the tri-annual date.
