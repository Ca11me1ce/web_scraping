WWII Vet, Sidney Walton, Visits
Trinity Academy for the Performing Arts
On April 26, 2018 Sidney Walton, a 99-year-old WWII veteran, made the first stop of his National No Regrets Tour, in Providence RI, when he visited with students at the Trinity Academy for the Performing Arts Charter School (TAPA).  Mr. Walton met with students from the 8th
, 9th
, 10th
and 11th
grades, along with members of the Historical Perspectives Department and other faculty members.  Mr. Walton’s son, Paul, answered many questions for his father and engaged in pleasant conversation with the students of TAPA. Students asked insightful questions of Mr. Walton ranging from his experiences before, during and after WWII, to what he has learned about life, having lived for almost a century. In 1941, Walton enlisted in the Army and soon he was off to northern India where he says he served with the infantry throughout World War II. The catalyst of his enlistment was his concern over Hitler’s atrocities, which resonated with him as a young man with a Jewish heritage. 
Mr. Walton is embarking on a 50-state capital tour of the United States. TAPA is honored to be chosen as the first school and students for him to meet on his historic mission. His son explained that one of the biggest regrets he has in life is that when he was a young man, he missed out on the opportunity to meet with Civil War veterans in his home state of New York.  Because of this regret, he has decided to tour the country and give anyone and everyone, the opportunity to meet a WWII veteran.  
While Mr. Walton and his son thanked the students for allowing him to come and spend time with them, Mr. Sousa, one of the Historical Perspectives instructors and Dean of Students, commented “it is not you who should be thanking us, it is us that needs to be thanking you.  If not for what you did and your service, we would not be here, so thank you very much.” With this comment, students loudly applauded Mr. Walton.   Sidney and his son will continue their tour in Boston.

TAPA VOICES, DRUMMERS & DANCERS LEAD THE #ENOUGHRI STUDENT PROTEST 3/14/18
Every member of our Ensemble stood up in their own ways to demand safety in our schools. Whether escorting students safely to-and-from the protests (which was done by staff and by Board Members), or sign making, or leading the dance pit on the snowy Statehouse steps, or maintaining a positive space for learning back at TAPA, this could not have happened without our incredible staff and students, and the support of our Admin, Board, and communities locally and nationally.
We are grateful for the press coverage drawing attention to this important event. Check out the TAPA Stars at:

For the second year in a row, high schooler Steven Rosario is repping RI at the national Shakespeare competition in NYC
By Sophie Hagen
This month, Steven Rosario is heading to New York City to the English-Speaking Union National Shakespeare Competition for high schoolers – for the second time. Last year, he was a semi-finalist. This year’s win in the state competition, Steven says, has helped convince him of his own acting skills: “I realize that it’s not a fluke.”

TAPA STUDENTS MAKING STRIDES IN THE CITY!
TAPA STUDENTS VISIT PPAC
TAPA RELOCATES TO DOWNCITY PROVIDENCE!
While its students were home and enjoying the holidays, TAPA: Trinity Academy for the Performing Arts, a premier public charter school, found itself suddenly homeless. TAPA’s former school building, built in the 1890’s and located in the West End, sustained significant structural damage in late December and was declared unsafe for habitation. In spite of around-the-clock construction and repair work, it became clear in early January that repairs would not be completed in time for the school year to resume. TAPA Administration was notified of the dire construction situation two days before students were scheduled to return from the holiday break. 
With less than one week to locate and secure a new location, with little hope but, determination and persistence, Nanci DeRobbio, TAPA’s Head of School, reached out to the City Administration and to the Diocese for availability of school sites. Unfortunately, available sites were in disrepair and not ready for immediate access. The TAPA team and Board of Trustees then looked to Paolino Properties and former Mayor of Providence, Joseph Paolino, Jr., a long-time supporter of the arts and public education. The Paolino team sprung into action to help find a home to educate 204 students in grades 7-12 for the remainder of the year. As a result of this help, TAPA will open its doors on Monday, January 9th at 150 Washington St., Providence, RI 02903. Students will have only missed three days of school. In the performing arts “the show must go on.” 
The move to 150 Washington Street “sets the stage” for TAPA in Down City Providence, being within walking distance of some of the state’s finest colleges and arts institutions. TAPA looks forward to finding its pulse in the beating heart of The Creative Capital.

2nd Annual Holiday Sharing Event
TAPA Celebrates Student Achievement in the Arts!
Providence charter school students play sweet music on donated instruments
PROVIDENCE, R.I. — They've long played before audiences in and outside Providence, but on Sunday a group of veteran rhythm and blues musicians were thrilled to share a small stage with a handful of local school kids.
That's because the students from Trinity Academy for the Performing Arts got their chance to learn how to play keyboards, drums and guitar thanks in part to these veteran musicians, members of the Rhode Island Rhythm & Blues Preservation Society.
As vice president Max Whiting explained when he stepped up to the microphone, the society donated instruments to the charter school to bolster its music program.
"Right now you are going to listen to the fruits of our labor," said Whiting, in introducing the students.
The student band, with four musicians and two vocalists, quickly launched into Sam & Dave's 1969 hit "Hold On."
"C'mon everybody! Let's help them out," said Whiting, urging the audience of about 50 to clap their hands. "All right! All right! All right!"
When the students, after alternating their band lineup, finished up a playlist that included Stevie Wonder's "Superstitious" and The Temptations "Ain't too Proud to Beg," performer Jessica Michicoj sat down with a smile.
"We wouldn't be able to do anything without the instruments," Jessica, a senior at Trinity, said after playing donated drums on several of the numbers. "I think it's awesome."
The nearly decade-old preservation society has long been running its "Instruments for Children Program," which seeks donations of guitars, violins, drums and more and then offers them to school music programs that typically struggle due to budget cuts.
But Sunday was the first time that the students who got to learn and practice on these instruments had the opportunity to perform for — and share the stage with — veteran musicians from the society.
"It's a very good program. I love to see what happens to these instruments," said veteran blues drummer Randall Ashe.
After the students played, Ashe took the stage with a quartet that included Whiting, Bob Greene and Paul Doucette.
Whiting's wife, Sylvia, who is secretary/treasurer for the society, said many school music programs were decimated during the Great Recession, to the point that they didn't even seek instruments. But several of them, including Woonsocket, are now trying to revitalize their programs and seeking instruments again.
"Some of these kids can't even afford to rent an instrument for a month," said Tom Colantonio, who runs the program for the society. He encouraged people to donate instruments "rather than just throw them out or bring them to a yard sale."
Alex Santiago, a Trinity senior who played lead guitar on The Temptations number, said he was fortunate to own his own guitar, which he used at the concert. But he and other students at Trinity use the donated instruments at the school all the time.
"Without all of these donations, we wouldn't be making all of this amazing music," Santiago said.
Avi David, Trinity's musician-in-residence, took the microphone between songs performed by his students to thank the society for the donations.
Speaking of his students, he said, "We are so proud of how far they've come."

​"Viola Davis' Emmy Acceptance Speech Strikes Chord With RI Students"
  PROVIDENCE - At the Trinity Academy for the Performing Arts in Providence, every child is working to    
  become a star.
﻿﻿﻿﻿  On Sunday night, the future stars saw themselves on stage when a woman from Central Falls became the  
  first female of color to win best actress in a drama.
  "The only thing that separates women of color from anyone else is opportunity,” Viola Davis said in her  
  acceptance speech.
 “The one thing that I took out of her speech was opportunity is not given to everybody, but for the ones who 
  take it - and they take advantage of it - are the ones that succeed and go further in life,” TAPA senior Shaydee 
  Saythideth said.
"Honestly, I think it's inspiring that people from your neighborhood can prosper and rise to that level,” TAPA senior Preston Powell said.
Others agreed.
"Now, we can say that somebody made it,” TAPA sophomore Steven Rosario said. “It sets the bar high, but think what we can accomplish."
The name Richard Jenkins isn't as well known, but students know his face. He won his first Emmy after years of working hard in Hollywood and at the Ocean State's Trinity Repertory Company. Jenkins, along with Davis, got their start at Trinity Rep. Jenkins even served as their artistic director. "To some degree, it’s like just keep working. Success might not happen right away,” said Tyler Dobrowsky of Trinity Rep.
The children might even get a chance to meet Jenkins when he helps direct “Oklahoma” in the spring.
“He came from Rhode Island, so I want to know how he did it so I can possibly follow that path too,” TAPA sophomore Idallis Taylor said.
Davis and Jenkins reminded them that anything can happen and even the smallest state has the ability to shine bright.

 MARS Camp, the program that launched summer of 
 2015 designed with TAPA Music Majors in mind, is 
 making headlines. Students and staff were 
 interviewed by Providence Monthly earlier this 
 month and will be featured in their next issue. 
 Student songwriters will also head to WBRU at the 
 end of October to showcase original work and share 
 their experience with the program. Kudos to the 
 students, Mr. Dodd, and Ms. Azriel.
 TAPA student talent showcased on Public Access 
 television! Senior Music Major, Angela Cooper, shared 
 her musical and poetical talents on the The Rebecca 
 Flores Show. The talented young musician was 
 interviewed by Ms. Flores, international award winning 
 artist, author, poet and TAPA Board Member, in early 
 September. Ms. Cooper candidly spoke about her 
 experience as a TAPA student and how attending a 
 performing arts school changed her life! The interviewed 
 aired on Cox Channel 13 on 9/14.
"FirstWorks exposed me to real music" said Music Major, Jaymi Cepeda, at a recent FirstWorks Board meeting. The 
 talented senior spoke eloquently before the Board on behalf of FirstWorks. She moved many to tears with her candid
 take on how the FirstWorks - TAPA partnership has shaped her as a musician. Way to go Jaymi!
