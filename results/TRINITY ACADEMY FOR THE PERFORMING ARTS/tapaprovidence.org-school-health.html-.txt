IMPORTANT: Communicate Your Child's Health Conditio

PARENTS/GUARDIANS ~ please be sure to call the School Nurse, Ms. Tuck, to discuss any health condition(s) your child may have. 
Good, and timely, communication is key to keeping your child healthy and safe at school! Nurse will write an IHP (Individualized Healthcare 
Plan) when necessary so that all teachers are aware of the condition and what to do in case there is an issue here at school. So important! Please keep in touch!
