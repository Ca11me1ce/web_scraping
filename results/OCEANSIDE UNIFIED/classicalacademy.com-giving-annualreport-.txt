 The Classical Academies Brings $70M to North San Diego County Economy 
The findings were reported in a December 2016 economic impact study researched and written by a team of California State University San Marcos students in the College of Business Administration’s Senior Experience program.
 The Caiman Way 
The 2016-2017 sports year was a successful one for Classical Academy High School Caimans, offering a total of 18 CIF sports. The boys’ volleyball team took home both a League and CIF Title in the spring. League championships were also achieved in football, girls cross country, and girls volleyball.
Classical Academy High School has continued to build on a strong partnership with parents and athletes. The implementation of The Caiman Way has spearheaded a shift in athletic culture focused on four key points: Working Hard, Living Pure, Leading with Courage, and Honoring the Team. This shift in culture is aimed at creating an environment of cooperation, responsibility, and leadership among student athletes.
 Coastal Academy High School Opens its Doors 
In 2017 Coastal Academy high School welcomed 200 students to the new oceanside campus.  Students selected a mascot and school colors, hosted their first homecoming, and added a variety of academic and social options to the program. Several highlights to this year’s programming include a multi-tiered culinary arts program, a robotics class, and a fully functioning biology, physics, and  chemistry lab.  With a particular emphasis on service learning, all students completed a Day of Service at the beginning of the fall semester. In the coming years, the school is looking to locate, purchase, and develop a permanent facility.

 CAHS Among Top Finalists in Samsung Contest 
The Classical Academy High School in Escondido was one of five California schools among the nation’s 255 state finalists in the Samsung Solve for Tomorrow Contest. This program encourages students to solve real-world issues in their community using classroom skills in science, technology, engineering, arts, and math (STEAM).
Fiscal Responsibility
The Classical Academies continue their long history of fiscal responsibility as a public agency. On December 1, 2017, the independent auditing firm reported “no findings” for the 2016/2017 fiscal year. In addition, Standard & Poor’s has given the organization a higher and more stable credit score. This score was then used to refinance our current facility bond of $29,600,000, capturing a lower interest rate and saving valuable taxpayer dollars. This refinance saves the organization $180,000 annually or $2.6 million over the life of the bond. All these factors speak to the strength of our business model that supports our academic programs and contributes to our long-term sustainability.
