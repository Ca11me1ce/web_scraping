Welcome
Welcome the The Classical Academy Vista!
My Name is Kirstin Lasto and as the Principal, I am excited to see your kids thrive in our blended programs. As a parent, teacher and leader, I understand the commitment you are making to educate your children. I value our partnership, and my door is always open to hear your ideas and get to know you!
The Classical Academy curricula combine the best E. E. Hirsch’s Core Knowledge Sequence, California state standards, and the best of classical education. Serving students in grades TK – 8, we offer a personalized academic program, giving students the flexibility to excel at their own pace. Students are encouraged to master the “basics” in an environment that buoys meaningful, intellectual stimulation. All programs are considered 100% Independent Study, although families are well supported by teachers and staff. Supplemental lessons are also provided in character education, and ties are made with art, music, and technology.
The school year is split into 6 – 6 week “units” with assignments and lesson plans provided to parents one week before the instruction begins, allowing parents to plan and prepare for the coming unit of study. Student work is assigned by credentialed teachers and reviewed at parent-teacher conferences, held every 6 weeks.
We strive to partner with parents to provide an academic educational model that is dynamic and engaging. Our small environment creates an atmosphere of supportive community and togetherness.
I look forward to seeing you on campus!
