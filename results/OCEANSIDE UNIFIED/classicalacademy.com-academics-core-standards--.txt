State Standards and Assessments
State Standards:
The Classical Academies adhere to all California State Standards, including Common Core. The implementation of Common Core within our program is under our control and we work with our teachers and parents to ensure that the integration of these standards fits within the uniqueness of our program.  The Common Core standards have been implemented at The Classical Academies and will be assessed by the state through student testing beginning in the spring of 2016.
These standards provide a clear and consistent understanding of what students are expected to know and be able to accomplish academically. The state standards articulate a set of goals and learning targets for K-12 students. The goal behind these standards is to best position students to compete successfully in the global economy, thus fully preparing all students for college, career and citizenship.
Assessments:
We use a variety of assessments to track understanding, monitor progress, and celebrate accomplishments. Assessments include use of teacher/parent created unit tests, skills and performance-based assessments.  We monitor annual personal growth using NWEA MAP (Measures of Academic Performance) assessments (K-8), California State performance assessments (3-10), and high school assessments including California High School Exit and AP exams.
