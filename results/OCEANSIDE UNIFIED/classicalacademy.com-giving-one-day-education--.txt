One Day For Education
One Day For Education
In honor of the Classical Academies 19th anniversary, April is the month of our annual One Day For Education Campaign.
We invite you—parents, community members, teachers, and alumni—to contribute by making a donation to sustain the student programs and options you value most.
Donate One Day of your annual salary, One Day of the cost of a meal out, or the cost of a cup of coffee; whatever your day may be,  share it with us!
Each campus has identified a special project that they hope to complete with fundraising. Each of these projects will benefit students.
We know that together we can make the difference. To participate, donate 
online
 or drop off a check to your school office. Donations are tax-deductible and a receipt will be provided.
We look forward to celebrating with you!
