Community Service
The Classical Academies values civic responsibility and encourages students to give back to their community through volunteerism and service. By participating in community service projects, students form positive habits such as focus on others, empathy, service, and the ability to collaborate as part of a team.
For each academic year that a student attends Classical Academy High School, the student is required to log 37.5 community service hours, which is a total of 150 volunteer hours over their four years of high school. Through community service, students build relationships with community members, gain valuable experience work experience, develop their character, and help strengthen their community.
