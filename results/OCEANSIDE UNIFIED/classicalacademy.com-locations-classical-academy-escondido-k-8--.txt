Welcome
My name is Kenna Molina, and as the principal, I am excited to see your kids thrive in our blended programs.  As a parent, teacher, and leader, I understand the commitment you are making to educate your children. I value this partnership, and my door is always open to hear your ideas and get to know you. We strive to partner with parents to provide an academic educational model that is dynamic and engaging with a focus on character education.
The Classical Academy serves students in grades TK-8. Offering a personalized academic program, students have the flexibility to excel at their own pace. Students are encouraged to master the “basics” in an environment that encourages meaningful intellectual stimulation. All programs are considered 100% independent study, although families are well supported by teachers and staff. Student work is assigned by credentialed teachers and reviewed at parent teacher conferences, which are held every six weeks.
Supplemental lessons are also provided in character education, and ties are made with art, music, and technology. Units are provided to parents one week before the instruction begins, allowing parents the time necessary to plan and prepare for the coming unit study.
Throughout the TK-12 educational journey, The Classical Academy inspires students, empowers parents, and promotes a life-long love for learning by creating an environment where academic success is personalized and achievable for all children. Parents, working with credentialed teachers, prepare, monitor, and implement programs that enrich, challenge, and inspire students to embrace personalized academic success.
I look forward to getting to know your family!
Kenna Molina
