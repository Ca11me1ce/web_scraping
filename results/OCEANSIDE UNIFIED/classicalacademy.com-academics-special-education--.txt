Special Education
The Classical Academies Department of Special Education mission ensures that children with disabilities receive a Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE) in the Least Restrictive Environment (LRE). We accomplish this by working collaboratively with families, students, teachers and other professionals to promote student success through individualized learning and support.
The Classical Academies is committed to serving the needs of all students. Our schools believe that the Least Restrictive Environment begins in the general education classroom/setting for all students, and supplemental aids and services are added to students’ education setting according to their individual need.
Students who are identified as having learning or behavioral disabilities are provided a comprehensive range of services as specified in students’ Individualized Education Plans (IEPs). The Classical Academies Special Education program includes a range of services for students found eligible under the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).
The Classical Academies believes in a team approach: student, parent, general education teacher, special education teacher, and any instrumental team member. This team works together to create and execute a plan to make the student most successful.
