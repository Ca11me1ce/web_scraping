Personalized and Blended Learning
One of our core values is that “rigor and relevance is personalized, acknowledging that all learn differently.” Consequently, personalized and blended learning are part of the educational environment, curriculum design, and infused with the content delivery.    
Personalized Learning is the tailoring of instruction, curriculum, and learning environments to meet the needs and aspirations of individual learners. Teachers, working with parents, create learning plans for students that can include technology, classrooms, labs, electives, and independent study options to complete their assigned academic program.
Blended Learning is a formal education program in which a student learns at least in part through online delivery of content and instruction with some element of student control over time, place, path or pace.
