Musical Theater
Musical theatre and the performing arts at the Classical Academies play an important role in a well-rounded education.  Integrating voice, acting, and dance, the performing arts programs offer a creative and experiential approach for students to think, communicate and achieve while engaging and enriching the broader community.
The Classical Academies offer various musical theatre programs for the younger grades through middle school and culminating in our renowned high school programs offered at the California Center for the Arts Escondido.
There are both fall and spring performances open to parents and the community.
