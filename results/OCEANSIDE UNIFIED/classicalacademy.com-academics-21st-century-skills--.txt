21st Century Skills
The Classical Academies strive to prepare students to be successful in the global world. Twenty-first-century learning must enable today’s students to be academically competitive within their community, country, and world. U.S. schools must align classroom environments with real-world environments in order to successfully prepare students to face rigorous higher education coursework, career challenges, and a globally competitive workforce.
As defined by the Partnership for 21st Century Skills Framework, these skills are grouped into three major categories:
Learning and Innovation Skills 
Critical thinking, communication, creativity, and collaboration.
Information, Media, and Technology Skills 
Effectively using, managing, and evaluating information from digital technology and communication tools.
Life and Career Skills 
Flexibility, adaptability, self-direction, teamwork, appreciation of diversity, accountability, and leadership.
