Parent-Teacher Partnership
It is a core belief at The Classical Academies that every parent partnership starts with trust, builds 
on collaboration, and culminates with accountability.  The partnership that we share with parents is the cornerstone of everything we do at The Classical Academies and one that we have come to rely on in helping all students become thinkers, communicators, and achievers.
