Message from the Principal
Thank you for your interest in Coastal Academy High School!  My name is Samantha Bartrom and I am honored to serve as your Principal. Coastal Academy High School serves grades 9-12 and provides high school students with academic choice and flexibility to personalize their education.Students may choose to attend class up to 4 days per week, participate in concurrent community college enrollment and receive one-on-one or small group tutoring.  Our program supports college bound students by assigning them an Academic Coach to provide guidance and mentorship.  Furthermore, Coastal Academy High School is committed to building student resiliency through intentional service learning & leadership development opportunities.
When our students are not in class, they enjoy working at our Cyber Café. Here 
students independently complete their schoolwork, receive personalized tutoring from one of our 
credentialed teachers, and connect with peers.  Students also have the option to participate in a wide range 
of extra curricular activities including sports, drama, culinary arts, ASB, various clubs & more. Coastal 
Academy High School offers a safe, welcoming environment with a commitment to academic excellence 
and strong moral character.  We partner with parents to individualize student learning and ensure all 
students become thinkers, communicators and achievers.
I look forward to connecting with you about options to serve your family.  If you are interested in learning 
more or scheduling a tour please contact our office at (760) 317- 9147.
