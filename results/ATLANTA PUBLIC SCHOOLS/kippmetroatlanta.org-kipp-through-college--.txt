About Us
Supporting Our Students To and Through College
KIPP Through College provides the critically-important support to help students gain acceptance into the best colleges for their individual dreams and needs, and turn these hard-earned college acceptances into college degrees. Our KIPP Through College team provides guidance and support throughout the college admissions, choice, and financial aid processes. All KIPP Metro Atlanta alumni – whether they graduated from KIPP Atlanta Collegiate or completed 8th grade at a KIPP Metro Atlanta middle school – are supported by our KIPP Through College team. We also provide programming for lower grades, including college visits and parent education to help families get an early start on financial and other planning for college. KIPP Metro Atlanta’s commitment to our students does not end with high school graduation. We stay connected to our alumni throughout their college journey to make sure they have the academic, social, and financial supports they need.
Learn more about our program and future plans.
KIPP Through College
