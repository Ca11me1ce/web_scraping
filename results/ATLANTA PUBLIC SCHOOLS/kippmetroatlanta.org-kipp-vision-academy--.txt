Academics
The academic program of KIPP Vision Academy is designed to challenge every student to achieve on or above grade level performance in all academic subjects. The school is focused on equipping students with the knowledge, skills, and scholarly habits necessary for success in an academically rigorous college preparatory high school. The school’s curriculum is based upon the Common Core State Standards, but is accelerated and taught rigorously to ensure that students are prepared for a college preparatory high school upon completion of the 8th grade.
KIPP Vision Academy provides standard-aligned, rigorous curriculum for reading, language arts, math, science, and social studies at each grade level. The academic program of KIPP Vision Academy is focused on the core academic subjects, providing students with opportunities to “fill in any holes” that may exist in their academic skills or knowledge through an “accelerated spiraling” instructional approach. Teachers are typically teaching more content and skills than is typical in a given year, and are constantly reviewing and relating new material to prior knowledge and skills. As students become proficient in basic academic skills by fifth grade, the sixth through eighth grade academic program provides students with more challenging skills and a more content-rich curriculum. Students also participate in Advisory Courses which focuses on learning the school’s values, life skills, and habits of a successful scholar.
School Culture
KIPP Vision Academy is a learning environment that develops confidence and critical-thinking skills in our students to solve the most complex challenges of the world.
Values
Respect (Bi-Nka-Bi) – Students will consider the feelings and well-being of people and the environment before speaking and acting.
Unity (Nkonsonnkonson) – Students will work together to accomplish goals and to create a positive learning environment.
Positive Choices (Nyansapo) – Students will think thoroughly before acting.   Students will make choices that are based on the question “is this going to be good for myself, my family, my community and my school?”
Diligence (Aya) – Students will work hard to accomplish goals.
Fun (Dono) – Students will find the JOY in learning, interacting with peers and in school.
