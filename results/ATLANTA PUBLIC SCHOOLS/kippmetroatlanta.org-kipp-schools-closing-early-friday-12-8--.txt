KIPP Metro Atlanta  
All KIPP Metro Atlanta schools will be closing early today (Friday, December 8) due to changing weather conditions. Buses will follow our 1:30pm dismissal schedule. If you are picking up your children from school, you can pick them up starting now and it will be considered an excused absence. If your scholar typically rides the bus and you would like to pick them up directly from school today, please pick them up before the 1:30pm bus departure. All afterschool activities are cancelled.
Please stay safe and warm!
