Professional Development
It’s All About the Future. 
Your Students’ – and Yours.
KIPP Metro Atlanta Schools is a place where the learning never ends—even for teachers! You’ll receive on-going, high-quality professional development within your school, with the broader KIPP Metro Atlanta Schools region, and with the national KIPP network.
In Your School
Each school year begins with about ten days of professional development, and continues with about five Teacher Planning days. These timely PDs and planning days feature training, practice, and conversations around curriculum and culture. Additionally, department and grade-level planning time is built into each school day and week.
We know that development is also personal, so our teachers also have weekly one-on-ones with an instructional coach where they get real-time feedback on lesson plans and classroom observations. Full of candid and productive conversations about what’s working and what’s not, this focused and practical back-and-forth is at the heart of our team’s growth. You’ll also have access to a regional Academic Support team that’s dedicated to developing and supporting our teachers and school leaders.
The KIPP Metro Atlanta Schools Region
Across all eight of our schools in Atlanta, our teachers connect and collaborate for workshops and sessions across grade levels and subjects. Teachers, assistant principals, and principals also collaborate in cross-school working groups on an ongoing basis to review curriculum, develop assessments, and identify best practices.
Additionally, all KIPP Metro Atlanta Schools employees, instructional and operational alike, gather at least twice a year for fellowship and celebration and to receive updates about the region.
The National KIPP Network
KIPP’s national network of schools is supported by the KIPP Foundation, which helps schools learn, share, and grow. KIPP teachers have the opportunity to come together for a week of learning and community-building at the 
KIPP School Summit (KSS)
. This network-wide event offers learning experiences with high-quality presenters in academic content areas and effective and culturally relevant pedagogy. While maximizing opportunities for sharing and collaborating with colleagues, KSS also ensure that teachers and instructional leaders walk back into their schools each fall armed with best practices and tools that they can implement immediately.
For emerging school leaders, the KIPP Foundation runs the nationally-recognized 
KIPP School Leadership Program
 over the summer and during the school year to support the development of teacher leaders, assistant principals, and individuals selected to lead KIPP schools. These leadership development programs include classroom learning, collaborative projects and residencies in KIPP schools around the country.
Finally, all KIPP teachers have access to KIPP Share, an online platform that enables KIPP teachers across the country to share curriculum, connect with teachers across the network, and explore popular classroom resources. It’s a growing treasure-trove of material that makes our teaching better and our lives easier.
