Academics
At KIPP Soul Primary, scholars will develop a passion for learning through their first instructional experiences. Scholars will have multiple opportunities to grapple with their thinking through exploration of academic concepts. Teachers cultivate confident scholars in literacy, complex mathematical topics, exploration of history, and scientific discovery through rigorous instruction and discourse. Teachers cultivate opportunities for scholars to productively struggle as they begin to explore the world around them and form an understanding of their unique scholarly identities. Each scholar will be honored as a unique individual and through the usage of data, individualized instruction, and open-ended conferencing, scholars will bloom as empowered, creative thinkers. Scholars will develop the educational tools today so they are ready to rise up as leaders in our community tomorrow.
School Culture
At KIPP Soul Primary, we wholeheartedly trust in the power of our voice, value the dynamics of our relationships, and honor the stories of those who have come before us. As a Team & Family, we will share our own history and courageously advocate for the education and lives we deserve. Scholars will actively reflect on their own identities, discuss and engage in restorative justice to create solutions for themselves and their lives that empower them to rise to their greatness. We believe strong relationships with each other, our families, and our communities will guide our path as we emerge to be critical thinkers with a passion for learning. We know that what we do today matters and the respect, love, courage, tenacity, and soul we develop for ourselves and those around us support our growth as we bloom into socially responsible scholars who will transform our current reality.

KIPPster Support Conferences
KIPPster Family Leadership Academy – KIPP Soul Primary School invites all families to participate in our KIPPster Family Leadership Academy (KFLA) to involve families in supporting school operations and realization of our school vision. The KFLA exists first and foremost to support the instructional program and school values of KIPP Soul Primary School. The KFLA will meet monthly during the school year. Families are highly encouraged to get involved in the life of the school by attending KFLA meetings as often as possible.
