CHARACTER & ACADEMICS
KIPP’s Formula
Academics + Character = Balanced Approach for Success
At KIPP Metro Atlanta Schools, we believe that success in college and the world beyond is made possible by a strong academic foundation and well-developed character strengths. KIPP’s longstanding motto sums it up: Work hard. Be nice. Character education and focus is embedded in classroom lessons, school culture, and professional development training.
Focusing on 7 Strengths
KIPP’s character work focuses on seven highly predictive character strengths that are correlated to leading engaged, happy, and successful lives:
Zest
Grit
Optimism
Self-Control
Gratitude
Curiosity
Social Intelligence
