Frequently Asked Questions
School FAQ
KIPP Metro Atlanta Schools
Answers to your questions about KIPP Metro Atlanta and Charter Schools.
Common Questions
about KIPP & Charter Schools
Are KIPP schools public schools?
Yes, all of our schools are tuition-free public charter schools. Like traditional school districts, we receive public funding and are accountable for strong academic results and sound financial practices. Public charter schools, however, are given more academic and budgetary flexibility than traditional public schools, and in exchange commit to delivering specific results.
What are charter schools?
Charter schools are publicly funded, independently operated schools that are allowed to operate with more autonomy than traditional public schools in exchange for increased accountability. Some charter schools are stand-alone institutions, while others, like KIPP, operate as part of larger school networks. Every charter school has an authorizer that is responsible for holding charter schools accountable for compliance with their operating agreements (“charters”). KIPP South Fulton Academy is authorized by Fulton County Schools; our seven other schools are authorized by Atlanta Public Schools.
Like all public schools, charter schools are:
• Tuition-free and open-enrollment
• Non-sectarian and non-discriminatory
• Funded primarily through a combination of federal, state and local tax dollars
• Held to state and federal academic standards
Who attends KIPP schools?
KIPP schools are open-enrollment public charter schools, serving students in educationally underserved communities.
What grades does KIPP Metro Atlanta Schools serve?
For the 2017-18 school year, KIPP Metro Atlanta Schools will continue serving all grades, K-12. However, because KIPP schools open one grade level at a time, one of our elementary schools will not offer all elementary grades until the 2018-19 school year.
Questions about Enrolling a Student
in KIPP Metro Atlanta Schools
Does KIPP Metro Atlanta Schools have any admissions requirements?
Any student can attend a local KIPP school, as long as they meet the residency requirements of the local school district and there is space available at their grade level. Any student who qualifies for public school qualifies for KIPP, regardless of prior academic or behavioral record.
Do students have to pay tuition to attend KIPP Metro Atlanta Schools?
No. All KIPP schools are free public charter schools.
How can I enroll my child in KIPP Metro Atlanta Schools?
To enroll your child in one of our eight schools, you must complete an electronic application during the open-enrollment period, beginning January 1st of each year. If a school receives more applications than space permits, a random lottery is held in the late winter or early spring to determine admission. All students who apply after the open enrollment period ends are added to the waitlist on a first-come, first-serve basis. To learn more about enrolling your child in one of our schools, visit our 
Enrollment
 page.
For a child to enroll in Kindergarten at KIPP Metro Atlanta Schools, by what date do they need to turn five years old?
Like all public schools in Georgia, students must turn five years old by September 1. If you would like to enroll your child in Kindergarten for the 2016-17 school year, your child must turn five years old on or before September 1, 2016.
Do KIPP students wear uniforms?
Yes, students at each of our schools are required to wear uniforms each day. Uniform shirts are provided by an outside vendor for a small fee.
How does KIPP recruit students?
Our schools use a variety of methods for recruiting students, from hosting open houses to presenting at community meetings to encouraging word-of-mouth. We strive to expand awareness of our program and schools so that as many families as possible know that KIPP is an available educational option for their children.

Ongoing content area workshops, online collaboration and communities with KIPP schools nationwide, and personalized instructional coaching are just a few examples of what we do to help our teachers succeed.
What are the requirements for teaching at a KIPP school?

Other Questions about KIPP
Does KIPP Metro Atlanta Schools receive public funding?
As public charter schools, we are primarily funded through a combination of federal, state, and local dollars with state funding representing the majority of our public funding. Charter schools receive less public funding than traditional district schools which requires us to raise funds from private sources to provide a robust and well-rounded college-preparatory education. In the 2016-17 school year, public funding covers approximately 90 percent of our operating budget.
Are donations to KIPP tax deductible?
Because KIPP Metro Atlanta Schools is a 501(c)(3) organization, all donations are tax-deductible as charitable contributions. You can learn more by visiting our

Does KIPP keep track of its alumni who go on to college?
KIPP closely tracks and supports the students who graduate eighth grade from KIPP middle schools and/or enroll in ninth grade at KIPP high schools through our 
KIPP Through College
 (KTC) program. KTC aims to empower each middle school and high school graduate to continue using the scholarly habits, academic knowledge, and life skills they obtained at our schools as they continue on the path to college and beyond.
What is the role of the KIPP Foundation?
The KIPP Foundation recruits, trains, and supports leaders to open locally-managed KIPP schools. The KIPP Foundation supports excellence, growth, and sustainability across the network, as well as leads network-wide efforts to innovate and share best practices. The KIPP Foundation also provides a variety of supports and services such as legal services, technology, communications, and marketing.
