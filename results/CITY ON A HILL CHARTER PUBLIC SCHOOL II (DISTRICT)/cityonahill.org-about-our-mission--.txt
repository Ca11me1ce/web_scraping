Our Mission
City on a Hill graduates responsible, resourceful, and respectful democratic citizens prepared for college and to advance community, culture, and commerce, and to compete in the 21st century. We do so by emphasizing academic achievement, citizenship, teacher leadership, and public accountability.
Academic Achievement
We strive to maintain high academic standards and ensure results. We acknowledge our students’ competition and seek to find additional resources to prepare our students to compete.
Citizenship
We prepare our students to exercise their rights and responsibilities as democratic citizens by emphasizing their responsibility to question, to act, and to avoid complacency. Examples of citizenship education at CoaH include ninth grade civics class, regular school wide Town Meeting featuring student-led debate, and City Project, the capstone course focused on public policy.
Teacher Leadership
Teachers take responsibility for the performance of students and of our schools. Our teachers are reflective practitioners and managers who drive decision-making in doing, building, and growing City on a Hill. They are contributors to urban public school reform.
Public Accountability
City on a Hill expects to show positive results to the taxpayer. We invite the public in to ensure that we are delivering on our promise to educate our students, and we engage parents and guardians as key stakeholders in our schools.
