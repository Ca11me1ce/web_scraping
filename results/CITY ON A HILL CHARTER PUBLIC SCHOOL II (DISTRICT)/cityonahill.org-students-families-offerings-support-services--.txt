Support Services
At City on a Hill we are committed to supporting all students through high school – whatever their needs may be. Our dedicated tutors, Special Ed staff, and ELL staff, will ensure your child’s needs are met and that they will receive a high quality high school education.
AmeriCorps Tutorial Program
Beginning in 2016-17, CoaH New Bedford has partnered with AmeriCorps and the Mass Service Alliance to provide literacy and numeracy tutoring to students. This new partnership has allowed the program to grow from one that serves only 10th graders two days per week, to one that serves 9th and 10th graders 5 days per week and provides additional after school academic support to those most in need. CoaH has 10 amazing full-time AmeriCorps members giving their year of service to the students of New Bedford.
COAHCorps Program
At our Circuit Street and Dudley Square locations, our CoaH CORPS members provide daily, personalized tutoring in small groups of 3-5 students to students in the 9th, 10th and 11th Students work with their tutor for 65 minutes a day, every day for the length of the school year, building literacy and numeracy skills. Individualized lesson plans are designed to target all learning levels. CoaHCORPS members are college graduates completing a year of service with City on a Hill.

Advisory
Each student is assigned an advisor when they enter City on a Hill that remains with them until they graduate. Advisories meet every day for academic help, discussions and more. Advisors are available to answer students’ questions and concerns throughout their time at CoaH.
Special Education
City on a Hill welcomes students with disabilities. We refer to our special education services department as the Learning Network or LN. The LN ensures all identified students are academically successful and receive comprehensive student support. This department serves all students with disabilities including emotional and/or communication disorders, neurological, health and intellectual impairments and various specific learning disabilities.
The majority of our students requiring special education receive services in an inclusive model. We provide trained inclusion professionals working alongside regular education teachers to meet each student’s individualized needs within the general education setting. While all students participate in some level of inclusion programming, City on a Hill’s special education services are flexible and dynamic, adjusting its inclusion model to accommodate individual students’ IEPs.
City on a Hill’s college-prep standards and program applies to all students, including all students with disabilities. Students with disabilities are provided with the supports and accommodations necessary to reach these high standards.

English Language Learners
City on a Hill welcomes English Language Learners (ELL). City on a Hill uses a Sheltered English Immersion (SEI) model in order to ensure that our ELLs are appropriately supported. There are two components to the SEI model. The first component is English Language Development (also known as ESL classes). Students receive between 2.5 hours a week and 12.5 hours a week of ESL provided by a licensed ESL teacher (amount depends on the English proficiency of the student). ESL provides students with direct instruction in the English grammar, vocabulary, reading/writing strategies, etc. so that students are able to acquire the English language as rapidly as possible. The second component of SEI is Sheltered Content Instruction. Sheltering content means that supports are added into the curriculum in order to make it easier for students still learning English to understand and access materials and content. All sheltered curriculum is delivered in mainstream classrooms and at no point are standards lowered. With supports, all English Language Learners are expected to meaningfully participate in City on a Hill’s curriculum.
City on a Hill’s college-prep standards and program applies to all students, including all English language learners. English Language Learners are provided with the supports and accommodations necessary to reach these high standards.
