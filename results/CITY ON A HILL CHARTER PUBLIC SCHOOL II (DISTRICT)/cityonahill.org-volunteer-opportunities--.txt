Become A Community Juror
We invite community members to serve as jurors for our annual proficiencies each June.  City on a Hill proficiencies are designed to allow students the opportunity to publicly demonstrate their knowledge of a particular subject and/or question.
Community members serve on a jury with a teacher and a student and will observe, evaluate, and provide constructive feedback to students in the oral component of their exams.  This has shown to be a great experience for the community members and the students!
For more information about participating as a juror in the Spring contact:
Sam Larkan, Development Manager
