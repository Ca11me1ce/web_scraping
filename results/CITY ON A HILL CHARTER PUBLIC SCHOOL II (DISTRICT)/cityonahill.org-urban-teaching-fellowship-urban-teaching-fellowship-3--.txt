UTF Responsibilities and Support
Responsibilities and Supports
“Rigor with support” is one of the central mantras of the Urban Teaching Fellowship. Fellows learn by working with an experienced mentor teacher, slowly ramping up to taking over full responsibility of two of his/her classes. Fellows have many responsibilities; however, in order for them to be successful, it is also important that they receive a lot of guidance and support.
Responsibilities of Teaching Fellows
Fellows are expected to uphold the standards and carry out the rules and regulations of City on a Hill as any full-time employee of the school. In this role, there is a balance of academic and non-academic responsibilities (lunch duty, substituting classes, lesson planning, chaperoning field trips, etc.).
Teaching Fellows are responsible for:
Passing the Communication & Literacy and their subject-area MTEL exams
Participating in Freshmen Academy and faculty orientation week
Observing their mentor teacher, other teachers, and each other
Participating in all department, planning, and three-way meetings
Leading increasingly longer sections of class in the fall
Taking full responsibility of two classes in the spring
Taking the lead on planning at least one unit in the spring
Working with Learning Network liaisons to accommodate and modify curriculum and assessments
Demonstrating competence on DESE’s Candidate Assessment of Performance
Performing an oral defense of their Teaching Portfolio
Assuming full responsibility of their department’s summer school sections
Support of Teaching Fellows
Fellowship cohorts are always small in order to ensure that Teaching Fellows receive the maximum amount of support from each other and from other members of the City on a Hill community.
Teaching fellows will be supported through:
The peer support of a small, tight-knit cohort
Weekly check-ins with the Director of Teacher Development & Licensure
Daily interactions with their experienced mentor teacher
Being an integral member of the collegial, teacher-centered community at City on a Hill Charter Public High Schools
