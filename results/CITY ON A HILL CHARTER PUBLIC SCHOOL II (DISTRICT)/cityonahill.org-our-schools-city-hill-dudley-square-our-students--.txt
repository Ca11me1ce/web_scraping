Testimonials
“My advisor. He’s amazing. Every week we have check ins. If we don’t understand why something is that way, he will break it down and explain.  He helps motivate us” – Destin, Class of 2020
“I really think this school sets us up for real life situations. And they really help us get to that next level, which for now, is college.” – Derrick,Class of 2017
“I really like the levels and hard work. All the teachers really push us to do more than what we thought we could have done, if they didn’t push us as much as they do then we probably would not be as mature and the desire to be really successful, probably wouldn’t be there” – Paola, Class of 2018
