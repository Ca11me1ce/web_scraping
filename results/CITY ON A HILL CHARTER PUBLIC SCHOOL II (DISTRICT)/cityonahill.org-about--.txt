About Us
City on a Hill Charter Public Schools is a network of three college preparatory high schools in the cities of Boston and New Bedford.  Each City on a Hill school is tuition-free and open to all students.  CoaH schools do not have entrance exams; students are admitted by a random lottery with new students admitted in the ninth grade only.
City on a Hill believes first, and most centrally, not just that all students can learn, but that all students must learn in order to address the social, economic, and political inequities of our nation. We approach learning accordingly and work tirelessly to prepare our students for success in college and beyond.
City on a Hill serves students who are traditionally underserved by the public school system. The majority of students arrive performing significantly below grade level. However, 100% of City on a Hill students pass the MCAS, and 91% of recent graduates have enrolled in college.
