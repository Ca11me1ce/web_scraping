CoaHCORPS Testimonials
Elena Sicairos, COAHCORPS II
Clark University
Psychology & Race and Ethnic Relations
Hometown: Boston, MA
As someone who grew up in Boston, coming back from school to give back to my community was very important to me.  Being a CoaHCORPS member has allowed me to take my experiences and strengths to help today’s Boston youth.
It has been a challenging, rewarding, and fun experience.  I believe I have learned as much from the students as they have learned from me.
Damon Peykar, CoaHCORPS III & IV
University of Santa Barbara
English
Hometown:  Tehran, Iran 
Working at CoaH was an unparalleled experience for me.  Moving from the west coast to an urban high school in Boston was a big move, but my co-tutors, students, and the faculty filled me with a sense of support and belonging.  Still, the job was extremely demanding.
Eventually, those initial weeks and months passed, and students helped me learn how we could best spend our valuable time together.
Alexandra Chiu, CoaHCORPS IV
Smith College
Government and East Asian Studies
Hometown:  Malden, MA 
Initially CoaHCORPS was not a position I had seriously considered taking. My feelings towards CoaHCORPS changed after my visit and interview, because even as a stranger I felt welcomed to a community with a strong purpose, and I instantly knew that CoaH was the place I wanted to be. I have never felt happier or more excited about any other decision I have made.
Everyday at CoaH, whether with other staff or students, I spend some part of my day laughing and learning more reasons I love being a part of this community. It is a lot of work, but there is more support and dedication here, than anywhere else I have been.
Emily McCaffrey, CoaHCORPS IV & V
Boston University
Political Science
Hometown:  Troy, NY 
I decided to join CoaHCORPS because I was looking for an opportunity to work closely with students in an urban school, while also deciding if teaching is the right career for me.  City on a Hill provides an incredible environment to build relationships with extraordinary students and passionate teachers.
As a CoaHCORPS tutor I am meaningfully impacting my students’ academic and personal success, while also learning about the crucial skills and structures needed to create an education system in which all children have the opportunity to achieve.  Tutoring is one of the most challenging, relevant, worthwhile, and fun experiences I have ever had.
Kevin Wilson, CoaHCORPS VI
University of Michigan
Cellular & Molecular Biology
Hometown:  Plymouth, MI 
My time at City on a Hill has been an unmitigated pleasure. As a member of CoaHCORPS, I have had the privilege of working with a committed team to focus, inspire, and push a wonderful group of students. It is, without a doubt, a challenging position, but the rewards are more than worth the struggle. The relationships I have built (with both students and other faculty) and the lessons I have learned are and will continue to be invaluable. You will, as a member of CoaHCORPS, develop interpersonal and organizational skills relevant to the pursuit of any career path, whether it be in education, medicine, law, or any other field. And along the way you’ll have the distinct satisfaction of seeing (and helping) your students grow and learn. I am proud to say that no matter where I go from here I am a part of the City on a Hill community.
