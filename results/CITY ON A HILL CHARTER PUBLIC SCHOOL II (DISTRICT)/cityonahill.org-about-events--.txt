City on a Hill Annual Gala
The annual gala has grown to be City on a Hill’s principle fundraising event and major contributor to City on a Hill’s unique programs, continued growth, and educational initiatives. It is an opportunity for staff, students, and supporters to gather and recognize the hard work and accomplishments of the past year.
2018 Annual Gala: 3 schools, 1 City on a Hill

Juries
Become a juror for our Juries!
Thank you to all our community jurors who participated this year! We truly appreciate you volunteering your time for our students. 
Juries take place during annual proficiencies. City on a Hill annual proficiencies are 
designed to allow students the opportunity to publicly demonstrate their knowledge of a particular subject and/or question.
We encourage community members to volunteer at our proficiencies to observe the public presentation and provide constructive feedback to the student as part of the evaluation process. It’s a great experience for both the community member and the student!
We will be looking for volunteers next spring (2018). If you have any questions before then, please contact Sam Larkan at 
slarkan@cityonahill.org
 or 617-533-9471.
