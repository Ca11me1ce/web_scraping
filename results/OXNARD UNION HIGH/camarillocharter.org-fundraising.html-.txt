Here's a great fundraising opportunity. Click to Amazon.com, and whatever you buy earns money for CAPE. There's no increased cost to you and no limit to what you can buy. If you have Amazon gift cards, free shipping, or any promotions, they'll all be honored. Just be sure to get there from here – and your school earns money! Proceeds go toward improving CAPE programs. Thanks.
