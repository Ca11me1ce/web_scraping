Academic Calendars
The Academy for Science and Design academic calendar is approved by the ASD Board of Trustees, and follows that of the Nashua School District as much as possible The exceptions generally are:
ASD's first day of school is usually on a Monday whereas Nashua schools often start on Tuesday
ASD holds a full-day Teacher Workday on those days where Nashua has early release for teacher professional development. This is because half-days are often not practical for our students who commute from longer distances
ASD usually has a slightly longer Holiday Break in December.
The last day of school at ASD may be earlier than Nashua or surrounding districts. This is because of our longer school day, and the fact that we are allowed up to five Snow Packet days that do not need to be made up at the end of the year.
