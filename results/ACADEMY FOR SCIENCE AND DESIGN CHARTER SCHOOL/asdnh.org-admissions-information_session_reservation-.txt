Information Session Reservation
Mandatory Information Sessions
:
Both dates have past, the reservation form has been removed from this page for the 2018-2019 school year application cycle. 
Mandatory Information Sessions for the 2018-2019 Admissions Year will be held on Saturday, October 21, 2017, and Saturday, December 9, 2017, from 9:00 am - 12:00 pm with required registration beginning at 8:15 am. Each applicant along with 
one parent or guardian must attend one of these two Mandatory Information Sessions in its entirety for your application to be complete to be eligible for the admissions lottery. This applies to all applicants, even if you have attended one in the past or have a child currently enrolled at ASD (no exceptions). Please note that if you arrive after 9:10 am that you will not be allowed to enter and will not receive credit for having attended. Due to fire code and building capacity restrictions, all applicants will be required to register for one of the Mandatory Information Sessions in order to attend. 
Admissions Information Sessions are the 
only
 opportunity for prospective students and their families to visit the school and attending an information session in person is an application requirement. The application will not be considered complete, and an applicant will not be eligible for the admission lottery if the applicant along with one parent/guardian has not attended an information session at ASD. Attending ASD is a commitment, and we want to be sure that each and every applicant and family is aware of what the rigorous academic program at ASD entails.
