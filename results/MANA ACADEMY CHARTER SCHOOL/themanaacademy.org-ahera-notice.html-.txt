AHERA - Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act
In 1986, Congress passed the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act (AHERA).  AHERA is a provision of the Toxic Substances Control Act. It requires that local education agencies (LEA) such as Mana Academy inspect for asbestos-containing building materials, prepare and maintain up-to-date AHERA Management Plans, and notify occupants of the plan on a yearly basis.  All of this in an effort to prevent the exposure of asbestos to the occupants of our school buildings.
Our architects and builders have certified that no asbestos containing materials were used in the construction of Mana Academy’s buildings; therefore, no asbestos containing materials were identified.  We continue to be alert to ensure that suspected asbestos-containing materials do not pose a hazard to our students and staff.
Mana Academy’s AHERA Management Plan is available for review in the main office and has been submitted to the Utah Department of Environmental Quality/Division of Air Quality.
