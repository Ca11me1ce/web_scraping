AZ Child Find
What Is Child Find?
Child find is a component of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 2004 (IDEA ’04) that requires states to locate, identify, and evaluate all children with disabilities, ages birth through 21 years, who are in need of early intervention or special education services. This includes children who are highly mobile, such as migrant or homeless children, children suspected of having a disability even though they are advancing from grade to grade, private school students, and homeschool students. The Arizona initiative for child find is referred to as AZ FIND.
Developmental and Educational Services
for Children Ages Birth through 21 Years
Some children have more difficulty learning than others. They may have trouble achieving milestones in one or more of the following developmental or academic areas:
Vision and Hearing
Speech or Communication Skills
Motor Control or Coordination
Cognitive or Academic Skills
Behavior or Social Skills
A referral for early intervention or special education services can come from a parent, guardian, foster parent, family member, teacher, counselor, or the student who finds learning difficult. The earlier you express your concerns, the sooner your child’s needs will be identified and the sooner he or she will receive the help needed to succeed.
