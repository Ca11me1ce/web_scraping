The Ferris State University Charter Schools Office publishes a monthly newsletter                              that is mailed to all of our authorized academies, Academy Board of Director members,                              school administrators, and other individuals who may find the news of interest. Our                              intent is to highlight the achievements of our academies and publicize important events                              in the charter school movement. If you are not on our mailing list and would like                              to begin receiving copies of the newsletter, contact
