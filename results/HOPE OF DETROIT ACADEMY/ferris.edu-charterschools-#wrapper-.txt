Charter Schools Office
The Ferris State University Charter Schools Office focuses on student success and                              continuous improvement through quality oversight, professional learning opportunities,                              and relevant resources for its authorized public school academies.                           
When Ferris State University authorizes a public school academy it is an endeavor                              to positively transform the life trajectory of the students who attend that academy.                              The Charter Schools Office holds as its most fundamental goal that all students be                              prepared for success in college, work, and life. Test scores and knowledge are important,                              but are not enough to succeed in an ever-competitive and connected global community.                           
We believe that students must be able to apply knowledge to new situations, and to                              seek out new information though research skills and technological competence. To accomplish                              this, each academy must provide an environment to achieve academic excellence by delivering                              quality programming and instruction for the children it serves. The virtues of character                              that include the values of freedom, honesty, integrity, and civility, in addition                              to rigorous accountability to all stakeholders are a part of our vision for each school                              academy.
