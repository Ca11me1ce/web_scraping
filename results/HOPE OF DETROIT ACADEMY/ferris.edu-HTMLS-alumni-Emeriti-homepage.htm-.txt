Who Are We?
The Ferris State University Emeriti Association consists of faculty, staff and administrators                                 who have been granted emeriti status under Ferris Board of Trustees policy.                              
We serve as a professional and social organization for our members. Retired faculty                                 members from any division of Ferris are automatically considered emeriti. Others may                                 be granted emeriti status by the Ferris president and Board of Trustees.

Walt Luecke 
It is with great sadness that the Emeriti Association Board of Directors announces                                 the passing today of one of our longest-serving directors, Walt Luecke.   Walt served                                 for many years as our Social Chair, and he worked tirelessly to ensure that all of                                 our events were fun, as well as flawless.  Who will ever forget that endless list                                 of funny jokes and stories that he would read to us at our gatherings?   Walt’s humor                                 was always quick and well-timed, no matter what subject was on the agenda at our monthly                                 board meetings.  I can hear him now, saying “See, I told you so,” because he joked                                 at almost every meeting - with a twinkle in his eyes - that there was only one way                                 off the board.   We will miss this humor and also his wisdom, his wonderful event                                 skills and most of all, his friendship.                              
Walt’s obituary with the details of his service on Tuesday, March 27, can be found                                 at this link:
