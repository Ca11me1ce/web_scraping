Message from the Campaign Co-Chairs
Gary Granger, Campaign Co-Chair
Jeff Rowe, Campaign Co-Chair
We are passionate about 
Ferris State University.
This is a value-added institution, one that delivers an impressive return on investment.                                    By investing in their education, students graduate job-ready, prepared to stand out                                    as leaders in their careers. Industry, community and donors benefit by having access                                    to this talent pool of knowledgeable, involved and responsible citizens.                                 
We want to see this winning, value-added combination continue, to build on it and                                    to help it grow. As co-chairs of Now & Always: The Campaign for Ferris State University, this is our mission. We are excited about Ferris’ future, one that is driven by                                    opportunity, vision and need. With strong leadership and an experienced team in place,                                    Ferris is poised for success.                                 
Now is the time that we, Ferris and you, its supporters and co- visionaries, can make                                    a reimagined, reenergized and revitalized University a reality. 
We urge you to join us
 in supporting this campaign so that future generations of students can access Ferris'                                    unique, "go-to-work" education—one that benefits our region, our nation and our world.
