History
As a dropout prevention and recovery school established in 2003, Glass City Academy has given great attention to designing a curriculum that meets State of Ohio requirements as well as offering challenging classes for all students. Students, parents, and guardians work with the school’s director and counselor to design a personal graduation plan that includes accomplishments and credits already received.
While accepting all applicants ages 16-21, Glass City Academy is designed to accommodate the needs of young adults who have been unsuccessful in the traditional high school setting. These students are recognized by the State of Ohio as highly at risk of not completing high school. Glass City Academy’s mission focuses on successful completion for its students and thus achieves a Continuous Improvement ranking from the State of Ohio, and the federal AYP (Adequate Yearly Progress) rating.
The school is situated on a spacious campus on Monroe Street in Toledo. Large classrooms equipped with state of the art technology offer students opportunities to learn numerous skills demanded in the workplace. Resembling a small college campus, Glass City Academy features a “Study Island” in the atrium, a central computer center where students are able to work on tutorial software for Ohio Graduation Test preparation. Study Island is also used by classes and students for research, Independent Study papers, and subject area assignments.
Glass City Academy currently meets and exceeds the State of Ohio averages for proficient, accelerated, and advanced levels for the Ohio Graduation Tests in three of the five subject areas.
In 2012 Glass City Academy received a School Wide National Jefferson Award Bronze Medal for our students’ service to their local community.
In 2008, Glass City Academy received the Community Builder Award from United Way for helping to build a stronger, more caring community.
In 2007 Glass City Academy was recognized with the Lucas County Delta Project Award.
