Calamity Day Make-Up Assignments
As Glass City Academy meets exactly the minimum instructional hours required by the State of Ohio, we are required to make up any Calamity Days used throughout the school year.  Rather than adding student days to our calendar, Glass City Academy offers three days of internet assignments for the students.  This page contains links to those assignments or the assignments themselves.  It is arranged into Snow Days 1st, 2nd, and 3rd.  For students and parents please access the appropriate calamity day.
