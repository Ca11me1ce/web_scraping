Admission and Enrollment Policy
In reference to admissions and enrollment, Evolution Academy Charter School prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, national origin, ethnicity, religion, disability, academic, artistic, or athletic ability, or the district the child would otherwise attend in accordance with TEC § 12.111 (a) (6).
All prospective students are required to complete our basic Application for Admission form. Students will be contacted during our open enrollment periods prior to the first day of school and at other designated application periods as space becomes available.
Students are admitted using a lottery system. When an orientation is scheduled, all available applications will receive a lottery number. Numbers will then be randomly selected for an invitation to orientation. All applicants will receive two phone calls. Failure to provide working telephone numbers may exempt the student from admission. Evolution Academy may exclude from admission any student who has or is found to have a documented history of a criminal offense, a juvenile court adjudication, or discipline problems under Subchapter A, Chapter 37.
Upon invitation, all prospective students are required to attend a pre-scheduled orientation session in order to enroll. Two hours should be allotted for orientation. During this period students and parents will be required to complete a packet of paperwork required by the local and state authorities for school admission. Students are required to be present with a parent or guardian for the entire orientation. Adult students who are 18 years of age or older may attend without a parent or guardian.
Late or non-attendance will result in the applicant being placed back in the lottery to await future admission. The following documents are required for orientation of any student:
Birth Certificate
Social Security Card
Up-to-date shot records
Unofficial transcript
Withdrawl form from current school (not required for summer enrollees)
Any questions regarding the application process, the enrollment process, or upcoming orientations should be directed to the scheduling office at (972) 907-3755.
