Metro Center
IntelliSchool’s Metro Center campus opened in 2002 and is one of two campuses in the West Valley. The Metro Center campus is located at north 35th Avenue and Peoria, near I-17. It is accessible from two major Valley Metro bus lines: the 106 (Peoria West to 99th Avenue) and the 35 (35th Avenue North to Happy Valley).
Jeff Graves has been the principal at the Metro Center campus since 2016. Prior to becoming a principal, Mr. Graves was a special education teacher at IntelliSchool. Principal Graves believes flexibility is critical for success and is open to identifying unique approaches to help students learn. The Metro Center campus has an environment that is welcoming and nurturing of students from a variety of backgrounds, including those on individual education and 504 plans.
In addition to Principal Graves, the Metro Center is supported by three teachers, two counselors and a variety of tutors. This campus also offers math intervention services to students.
The Metro Center campus has three daily sessions. The morning session is from 8:00 a.m. – 12:00 p.m., the afternoon session is from 12:00 p.m. – 4:00 p.m., and the evening session is from 4:00 p.m. – 8:00 p.m. Students are asked to attend one session per day for a total of twenty school hours a week.
The Metro Center’s largest session is its morning session with approximately 50 students. At least two staff members are available per session, but oftentimes there are three or more.
During school sessions, snacks and drinks are available to students for purchase.
