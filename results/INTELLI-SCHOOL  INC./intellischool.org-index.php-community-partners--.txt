ASU
University Service-Learning (USL) offers courses examining community needs, the importance of civic engagement, and the effects of social injustices affecting our community.  ASU students enrolled in USL courses also complete semester-long community service with a nonprofit organization, social services agency or school serving marginalized populations.  ASU students gain real-word that exercise academic skills and knowledge applicable to each student’s major and career goals.  USL courses provide a win-win for both the students to learn and grow academically, personally and professionally, but also make a significant impact in the community.

notMYkid
IntelliSchool is pleased to partner with the not-for-profit organization notMYkid to present educational programs designed to inspire students to make positive life choices and avoid destructive youth behaviors. During these programs young adults who have overcome life-controlling addictions and behaviors share their personal stories with students. The goal of notMYkid is to increase awareness of the challenges kids face, provide information, and offer resources to support the success of students, families and educators. IntelliSchool looks forward to continuing to work with notMYkid to help both our students and our parents.

Thanks to Seed Spot for working to improve the lives of people and communities on a local, national, and global scale.
