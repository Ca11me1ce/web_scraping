IntelliSchool is one of the oldest public charter high schools in the Valley. We’ve been in Phoenix for more than twenty years. IntelliSchool began as an online-driven alternative high school for students that weren’t successful in a traditional high school setting. We’ve evolved and grown over the last two decades. Today we have four campuses Valley-wide. IntelliSchool locations offer the same curriculum, structure and environments, but each campus has a slightly different personality. Get to know our campuses and decide which one is right for you.
