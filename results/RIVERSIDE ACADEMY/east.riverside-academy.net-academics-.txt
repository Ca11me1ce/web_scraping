The Academics
The academy offers blended learning through the study island programming 
www.studyisland.com
The   school offers opportunities for students to graduate with a high  school  diploma and complete coursework at a post secondary institute.  All  students grades K-12 are made aware of these offerings in the  handbook.
The school board has a policy in place to monitor individual student growth twice a year by using either 
NWEA MAP
 or 
Scantron Ed Performance
 online and reports the growth of the students to the student and the parents at the end of each school year.
