Whether the teacher has met State qualification and licensing criteria for the grade levels and subject areas in which the teacher provides instruction;
Whether the teacher is teaching under emergency or other provisional status through which State qualification or licensing criteria have been waived.
The baccalaureate degree major of the teacher and any other graduate certification or degree held by the teacher, and the field of discipline of the certification or degree.
