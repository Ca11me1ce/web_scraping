Admissions
 Enrollment Application
The   Board of Directors will allow students who reside in Michigan to enroll   in the Academy in accordance with the limits set by the Board of   Directors.  Because space is limited, each student must enroll every   year.  Preferences will be in writing and given to currently enrolled   students and siblings of an enrolled student. When maximum enrollment   for a grade has been reached, applicants shall be placed on a waiting   list and admitted on the basis of a lottery system.
The   Board authorizes the Educational Service Provider or School Leader to   deny admission to any student who has a documented record of behavior   s/he believes would constitute a threat to the safety and well-being of   fellow students and staff.
