The third grade students experienced a rare and wonderful treat from the most delightful teachers with Japan on the Road. Kiko, Yasuko, and Sheryl brought a day in the life of Japanese students to the children in Mr. O’Brien’s class. The students were deeply interested and enthusiastic about their studies of the culture across the Pacific Ocean. The students learned to locate Japan on a map and how far away from Wolf Creek, Oregon it is to travel there. They looked at a model home of a Japanese family, learned what children in Japan eat for breakfast, and how they pack their backpacks for school. They were interested to learn that Japanese students bring their eating utensils to school each day and work extra hard to keep their school rooms clean. Students got to learn how to write their own names in Japanese and they learned several practical words. Our teachers from Japan on the Road also shared the Kamishibai Theatre Box to tell a story to the children in the Japanese traditional storytelling format. The third grade class was gifted the book, Kamishibai Man, by the lovely and talented Japanese teachers. We are filled with gratitude and appreciation for the many lessons learned about Japan and to our teachers from Japan on the Road!
You will need to turn your volume up high to hear the videos.
