Youth Recreation Program
FAQ’s
The Youth Recreation Program is one of the agency’s oldest. When the Guadalupe Center began in 1919, recreational outlets for immigrant Mexicans in the Westside were non-existent. Today, Youth Recreation is a year round program offering positive athletic activities at multiple sites with an emphasis on elementary and middle school children.
The program runs year-round with Baseball, Softball, T-Ball, Volleyball, Futsal, Soccer, Basketball, & Biddyball. As the demand for services continues to grow, our youth program has expanded in recent years to serve more neighborhoods in the urban core of Jackson County. We continue to partner with other non-pro ts, charter schools, church organizations, and the Kansas City Parks & Recreation department to provide these vital activities for the youth of our communities.
