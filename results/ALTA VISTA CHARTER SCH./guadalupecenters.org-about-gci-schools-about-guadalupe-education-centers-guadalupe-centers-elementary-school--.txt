Pre K/Elementary Schools
The vision of the Guadalupe Centers Pre K/Elementary schools is a family of critical thinkers who celebrate our culture and empower our community.
We believe our students are the first priority ensuring a culture of success. Our school provides a rich bilingual environment promoting academic excellence in all content areas.  The majority of our students started in 2013 as kindergartens and are currently fourth graders.
Building lasting relationships is one of our focuses as student’s transition next year to fifth grade bridging forward to the Guadalupe Centers Middle School and ending their educational studies at the Guadalupe Centers High School. We believe in education the whole child providing multiple opportunities and meaningful learning experiences. Our goal is to provide a quality education for your children and make each student’s school experience at the Guadalupe Center a positive and productive one.
Serving Pre-K through fifth grade.  We have approximately 66 Pre-K students and 500 Elementary students.
In order to bring our vision into reality we will:
Provide a safe, productive, nurturing environment for students.
Provide staff that will foster and enhance learning, and encourage appreciation of bilingualism and honoring the student’s native language.
Improve student achievement in all areas of the curriculum by providing a challenging academic program connecting learning with real-life applications.
Empower staff through staff development, focusing on the delivery of the instruction in order for students to reach their full potential.
Cultivate a partnership between school and community.
Increase parent involvement and provide a variety of programs and services to meet the needs of all students and parents.
