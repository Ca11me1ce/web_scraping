The Guadalupe Centers Scholarship Golf Tournament was established in 2004 to involve the community in the development of our future generation of leaders by support of the scholarship fund.
The tournament supports two scholarships:
The Tony Aguirre Scholarship:
 supports students pursuing a private high school education that are actively engaged with the Guadalupe Center as a program participant or volunteer.
Gilbert Guerrero Scholarship: 
supports graduates of the Guadalupe Centers (Alta Vista) High School pursuing a post secondary education, this could be a trade school or college degree.
Please enjoy a round of golf with other dynamic community members at Swope Memorial Golf Course on June 8, 2018. Links to register, sponsorship packages, and more information is listed below. 
We are certain our raffle prizes will pique your interest! If you have any questions regarding other golf specifics, please do not hesitate to contact the golf tournament coordinator, Valerie Coyazo at
