PTO Purpose
The purpose of the New World Prep Charter Middle School PTO is:
To have a way which provides for a strong healthy working relationship between families, school administrators and teachers.
To create links between teachers, administrators, parents and the community at large, in order to ensure that every New World Prep Scholar receives the best opportunities for learning and personal self-growth.
To provide opportunities for parent education and networking.
To facilitate communication between New World Prep School and parents.
To enhance and enrich the school programs and materials not offered by the school.
Every parent is a member of the PTO. Parents are encouraged to become active members of our Parent Teacher Organization (PTO) by attending meetings. Our PTO holds meetings every month. Please check the school’s monthly calendar for meeting dates, other parent/family events, and unexpected changes in scheduling. Meetings are held in English & Spanish.
The President of the PTO for the 2017-18 is Ms. Eve Williams. She can be reached at
