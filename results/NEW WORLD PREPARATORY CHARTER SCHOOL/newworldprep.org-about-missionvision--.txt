Mission / Vision
Our Mission
New World Preparatory Charter School (“NWP”) provides an exceptional education for students by employing research-based strategies to raise academic achievement through academic rigor and relevance, personalization, focused professional development, and meaningful family engagement and collaboration with the larger community. We build on our nation’s promise of opportunity by exemplifying the role social justice holds in shaping a community of the people, by the people and for the people. Our students will graduate from NWP with a strong academic foundation, an awareness of the needs of others, and with the social and emotional readiness needed to succeed in high school and graduate from college.
Our Vision
Our vision at New World Preparatory Charter School is to prepare students for higher education by providing meaningful curriculum that challenges them academically while nurturing character development. Students will gain the skills necessary to inquire about the world around them by actively participating in community-based projects.
