Help for problems affecting you or your school work. Counseling is off-campus and appointments are in a counselor’s office or through a mobile app. You make the arrangements, Texans Can Academies is not involved. Written parental consent is required for students under 18. Texans Can Academies pay an independent company for the program; no information is given to Texans Can Academies about who uses the program (federal law).
You decide when you want help, sooner is better. You decide how you want it: in a local counselor’s office or through a confidential mobile app.
Texans Can Academies does not want to know if or when a student uses the counseling service. It cares that students use it to help themselves.
What to expect:
– Up-to-three (3) counseling appointments for each problem, each year.
– Call a private number, 24 hours/7 days a week for emergencies or to schedule appointments.
– Expect to talk to caring people and to be treated fairly.
