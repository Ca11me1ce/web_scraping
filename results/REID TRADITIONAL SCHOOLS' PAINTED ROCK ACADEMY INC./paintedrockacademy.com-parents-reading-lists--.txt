READING LISTS
The books on these lists are reviewed and evaluated by the Painted Rock Organization of Parents, Library and Curriculum committee and recommended to Reid Traditional Schools to be placed on the recommended reading lists.  Books that are approved are listed below.  The lists include both fiction and non-fiction books by some of the best authors for children and young adults. A conscious effort is made to select quality books that appeal to a broad range of student interests, reading abilities and maturity levels.  Reviews and recommendations for the reading list take place on an ongoing, annual basis.
If you’d like to volunteer as a parent to review books for the reading list, please contact the 
Library/Curriculum Committee Chair
