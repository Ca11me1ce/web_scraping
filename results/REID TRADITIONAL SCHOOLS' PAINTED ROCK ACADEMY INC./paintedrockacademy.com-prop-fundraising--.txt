FUNDRAISING
We participate in various fundraisers throughout the year to benefit school events and programs.  We have a Fall product campaign selling items such as cookie dough or coupon books, plus other programs that earn money or equipment for our school, when you shop where you usually shop and buy what you normally buy!    Details about some of our ongoing fundraisers are provided below.  Remember that everyone can help our school.  Please ask your family and friends to join in and participate in these programs.

FRY’s COMMUNITY REWARDS
Box Tops For Education
Clipping these labels found on hundreds of your favorite products can help earn money for our school.  Each Box Top label is worth ten cents, and that adds up fast.  There are fall and spring contests for Box Top collections.  The class with the highest number of Box Tops collected will win a reward.  Click the button below for more information.

INK CARTRIDGES – Bring in any empty ink cartridge in a plastic bag to the front desk, and they will be recycled for cash for our school!
EScrip
Our school receives donations from the eScrip Program when families like yours sign up online or through the mail.  From then on, for the rest of the school year, our school receives money when you shop at any of their participating merchants (and there are a lot). Just one family that is signed up for eScrip can earn an average of $144 per year in contributions for our school!
Use the button below to sign up.  Be sure to type in “Painted Rock Organization of Parents” when selecting a school/nonprofit from the drop down menu.

Spring Fling
Spring Fling is one of our major annual fundraising events and is a fun-filled day for school and neighborhood families.  This event is one of the fun highlights for our children at PRA and is typically held in March of every year.
Below are some photos from our first Spring Fling which featured a Western theme.  Students could have someone “put in jail,” with bail paid for their release. Mrs. Szostak, PRA’s then-Principal, was a favorite “prisoner.”  A dunk tank, bouncy house, and kettle corn popped on site all added to the fun.
Other Fundraising Activities
Throughout the year we plan Family Fun Nights at local restaurants, with a portion of the evening’s sales being donated to Painted Rock Academy. Past events have been held at Yogurtini, Raising Cane’s, McDonald’s, and Peter Piper. Watch the PROP newsletter for the next opportunity to help your school by going out to dinner!
