ENROLLMENT
We believe that every child should receive a quality education as a foundation for a secure, successful future. America’s children deserve nothing less. We hope we will be able to partner with your family to provide your child with the education he or she deserves. You may review our admissions calendar below and complete a Pre-Enrollment Application to begin the admissions process.
We are very pleased with Painted Rock Academy and are glad we made the switch. ~ PRA Parent
You may submit a Pre-Enrollment Application to add your child’s name to the waiting list, and we will contact you when a classroom seat is available. Completing the online form does not obligate your child to attend Painted Rock Academy, but it does reserve your spot in line so that you can make a decision when a spot comes open. Please complete a separate application for each child in the family, including siblings of current students.
Reid Traditional Schools Admissions Policy - Click to View
Reid Traditional Schools are open enrollment public charter schools that do not charge tuition. If space is available in a grade level, students are enrolled in the school. In accordance with Arizona law, we reserve the right to refuse to admit any pupil who is under the age of five years on August 31st of the enrollment year, and any pupil who has been expelled from or is in the process of being expelled from another educational institution. Providing false information during the enrollment process may result in denial of admission or administrative withdrawal from the school.
Reid Traditional Schools ensures that all children with disabilities have the right to a free appropriate public education. In accordance with Special Education regulations, we screen newly enrolled students within 45 days of enrollment and strictly adhere to other related regulations.
Reid Traditional Schools does not discriminate in employment and/or enrollment practices. We do not limit admission based on ethnicity, national origin, gender, income level, disabling condition, proficiency in the English language, or athletic ability.

Our goal is that every student in every grade would be able to participate in the first day of school with their new classmates.
Kindergarten Information
Students must be five years old on or before August 31st of the school year for which they are applying. Future kindergarten students are scheduled for a  kindergarten screening. This assessment identifies areas that you can work on with your child during the spring and summer so he or she is assured a great start in our kindergarten curriculum.

 for kindergarten screening information. We do not make exceptions or perform testing to admit students to kindergarten who will not be five years old on August 31st.
Reid Traditional Schools’ Painted Rock Academy Preschool is dedicated to providing a nurturing educational environment that prepares four-year-old children for kindergarten success. Please click on the topics below for detailed information about our programs.
Our Kindergarten Readiness Curriculum
We provide a program based on developmental milestones that will foster a positive self image and social skills through reading readiness, pre-math, language developmental activities, music, art, and movement activities.
Thematic units will focus on:
• Phonemic awareness and letter recognition
• Awareness of print and early reading concepts
• Number recognition and early math concepts
• Critical thinking skills such as predicting, recalling events, and sequencing
• Music, Art, and Movement will be used to develop fine and gross motor skills.
Language and Literacy Development
• Instilling the love of reading through listening to fine literature
• Retelling stories and drawing pictures about stories
• Understanding the relationship between letters and sounds (early phonics)
• Knowledge of print
• Written expression with use of words or drawings to convey meaning
Mathematics
• Sorting
• Understanding directions (up, down, top, bottom, etc.)
• Recognizing numbers
• Simple problem solving
• Patterns and functions (basic shapes, colors, and classifications)
Science
As children explore the classroom and outdoor environments, they learn about science and the role it plays in our lives.
The focus is on developing an understanding of:
• Making and recording observations (the concepts of same and different)
• Exploring our environment (the five senses)
• Exploring our earth (weather, plants, and animals)
Music
Music is shared each day. Children enjoy listening to music, learning dance, creative movement, and singing.
Creative Arts and Expression
Experiences are planned for the sheer joy and excitement of self expression through art, including coloring, painting, drawing, and making objects and crafts.
Physical Fitness
Physical fitness activities are designed to help children develop basic motor skills (run, hop, jump, skip, etc.) and experience the meaning of team play.

How to Apply and What Happens Next
We encourage you to complete a Pre-Enrollment Application form to join the waiting list. Preschool waiting list applications may be submitted beginning the first Monday in November for the following school year.
Students must be four years old on or before August 31st of the school year in order to be placed on the Waiting List, and they must be fully potty trained. Placement in preschool is offered based upon the Waiting List. There is not a lottery for preschool placement.
In late March, we will begin notifying families that placement is available, and we will continue to contact families about registration until all places have been reserved. The $40 registration fee and first month’s tuition are required to reserve your child’s place; these payments are not refundable.
We would love to have every one of our preschoolers attend Painted Rock Academy’s kindergarten, but membership in our preschool program does not give priority placement status for following year’s Kindergarten class. We do, however, make sure our preschool families know when the public kindergarten Open Enrollment windows are, for the greatest likelihood of being offered enrollment.
