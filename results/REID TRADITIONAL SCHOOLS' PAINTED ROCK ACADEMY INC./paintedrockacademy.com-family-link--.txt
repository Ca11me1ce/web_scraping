FAMILY LINK
FamilyLink is Painted Rock Academy’s online resource to keeping our students’ parents and guardians informed of their children’s progress. Unless you decline to participate, you will be able to use any computer with Internet access to view up-to-the-minute information on your child’s grades and attendance records.
We value the teamwork between the teacher and the parent in ensuring the student’s academic progress. With FamilyLink, we can use this tool to keep communication flowing between school and home. When we survey parents each spring, being able to view grades online has been a frequent request. We are glad to be able to provide that for you now through this online tool.
