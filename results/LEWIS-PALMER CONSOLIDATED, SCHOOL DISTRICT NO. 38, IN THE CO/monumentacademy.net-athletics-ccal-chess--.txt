What To Expect
Participants on our 2018-19 Chess team will receive weekly training, online instruction and practice, and time to play games.  Instruction utilizes chess videos, chess database software, chess computer engines, and a variety of software programs for computers and mobile devices.  In addition, Mr. Wise, a U.S. Chess Federation rated expert, will coach and critique students’ games.  As daunting as all this sounds, this class is open to newcomers!
Skills taught include:
• Chess rules
• Basic checkmates
• Strategic thinking and planning
• Tactical awareness
• Chess notation (how to read scoresheets and record games)
• Using chess to improve critical thinking skills
• Chess as an analogy for making optimal life decisions
• Pattern recognition in chess
• Developing an opening system for White and for Black
• Basic endgame technique
• Tips for playing competitive chess
• How to use chess clocks
Chess is fun and fast-paced, and students will get the opportunity to compete against players from other schools both within the Central Colorado Athletic League, and out. Students can develop a lifelong love of the game—as Mr. Wise did!
