Community Partners
Kawaikini’s community partners are key in helping us achieve our mission and vision. Just as importantly, Kawaikini has a strong commitment to give back to the community. Our curriculum of project-based learning encourages students and teachers to undertake projects of benefit to the community. Students also have the opportunity to volunteer with community organizations and non-profit agencies throughout the academic year as a form of service learning.
