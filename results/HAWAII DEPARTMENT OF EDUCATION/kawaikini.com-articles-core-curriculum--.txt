Kawaikini’s core curriculum focuses on Hawaiian language & culture. Students in grades K-5 are immersed in the Hawaiian Language to the fullest extent possible during the day with formal English instruction beginning in the 5th grade for one hour per day. 
During grades 6-12, our students receive approximately half of their instruction in the medium of the English language, allowing the students at Kawaikini to become bilingual in both English and Hawaiian languages.
