By treating yourself at Papalani Gelato this Saturday, April 14th you can show your support for Kawaikini’s Farm-to-School Program!  A portion of each sale at both Papalani Gelato locations will be donated to Malama Kaua’i & Kawaikini’s Farm-to-School Program. A big mahalo to Papalani Gelato for their support.
