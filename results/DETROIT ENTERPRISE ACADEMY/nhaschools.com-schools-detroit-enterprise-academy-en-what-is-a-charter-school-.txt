What is a Charter School?
Detroit Enterprise Academy is a tuition-free public charter school open to all students in Michigan. Our program not only follows state standards, but offers a great college-prep education and custom-created moral focus program. Founded in 2004 by members of your community, we work tirelessly to give parents a better choice.
Frequently Asked Questions
What is a charter school?
	A charter school is a tuition-free public school that offers parents a choice. Like district public schools, charter schools are required to adhere to all federal, state, and local education, health, and safety rules and regulations.
Who can attend a charter school?
	Any student who meets the proper age and residency requirements can apply to attend. Please be aware it is customary for charter schools to hold random, public lotteries to accept students if they receive more applications than they have seats available.
How are charter schools different from public schools?
	Charter schools are held to the same standards as other district schools. Charter schools also report to an authorizer who determines if the school is meeting the goals in its charter.
What are authorizers?
	An authorizer is an entity that monitors the performance, finances, and organizational stability of charter schools, and has the authority to close schools that don’t meet required standards. Charter schools can be authorized by a state board of education, a state university, community college or local district.
How are charter schools created?
	When individuals want to provide an alternative to district public schools, they may opt to propose a charter to their state authorizing agency. These community leaders, parents, teachers, principals or businesses create a charter that outlines the following: 
Their program of study
The students they will to serve
Performance goals
The methods of assessment they’ll use to measure these goals
They then submit this charter to the state authorizing agency who either approves or denies their application.
How are charter schools managed?
	Charter schools can operate alone or be run by a management organization. In the case of those operated by management organizations -- like National Heritage Academies -- the management firm often provides central support to a number of schools, so each individual school can focus their energy on teaching and learning.
On a local level, individual schools can be managed by their own Board of Directors who provide guidance and oversight to the principal.
How are charter schools funded?
	Charter schools are tuition-free. They receive public funding based on their number of students, and receive grants to help with some start-up costs. Many charter schools raise funds to help with other expenses. Charter schools are also eligible for federal funding for programs like Title 1 and Special Education.
Are charter school teachers certified?
	Individual states have different requirements. National Heritage Academies recruits certified and highly qualified teachers.
