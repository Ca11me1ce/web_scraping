PCS Lunch Program
Students may purchase a school lunch or pack a lunch. Any outside food (McDonald’s, Hungry Howies, etc.) that is brought in is only to be given to your own child.  Birthday treats are allowed on the playground after lunch only. These treats must be individually packaged and store bought.
* There are no microwaves available
* No Sodas or energy drinks are permitted
* No glass containers of any kind are permitted
If your child has allergies or special medical needs please pack their lunch. There will be an “allergy free” table available in the lunch room if needed.
Volunteers are GREATLY APPRECIATED and NEEDED! Each day from 11:00 – 12:00 pm we could use you! Please sign in at the office before coming over to the cafeteria.
