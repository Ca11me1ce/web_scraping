In the fall of 1993 she graduated from NAU with a dual degree in Elementary and Special Education. Her love of teaching was temporarily put on hold by her desire to be a stay at home mom to her children Andrew and Morgan. Tracy and her husband Kurt found The PEAK School when they began the search for a quality education for their children. After such a wonderful education experience for her own children, Tracy knew there was no other place she'd like to teach, and accepted a part time teaching position at The PEAK School in the fall of 2005.  Thirteen years later with her own children grown, Tracy’s passion to make The PEAK School an amazing place continues. When she's not working with teachers or students, Tracy can be found enjoying camping, fishing, and hiking in Flagstaff's beautiful surroundings.G3¬bð¹ÈÕæú]åcö	´¯`N'ãñoE¿[±l¥E4¿ O_~®CõXÙí4Ã~bäPy±Ì	Å2Ã)NG3¬bð¹ÈÕæú]åcö	´¯`N'ãñoE¿[±l¥E4¿ O_~®CõXÙí4Ã~bäPy±Ì	Å2Ã)NMelissa Rahn is the Title I/Special Education Teacher and RtI (Response to Intervention) Coordinator at The PEAK School.
