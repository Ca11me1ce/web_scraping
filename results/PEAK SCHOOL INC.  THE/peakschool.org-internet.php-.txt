* INTERNET POLICY *
 The purpose of this Internet Use Policy is to safeguard PEAK School students and staff when they access the internet.  This policy will serve to inform school staff, students, parents, and guardians about the proper and improper use of the school's computer network and the Internet on school premises.
The PEAK School network and internet are privileges.  If these privileges are abused they can, and will, be taken away.  They will be used strictly for school-related educational purposes such as research and work related e-mail.  They will not be used to perform any illegal activity.  Such activities include: downloading pirated software and music, gambling, viewing pornographic material, etc.
The PEAK School does its best to keep the network operating but it does not guarantee that it will be functioning at all times.  Internet access is also provided through the network.  The PEAK School does not guarantee the accuracy of information found on the internet.  Also included in the network is filtering software used to prevent inappropriate information from being viewed.  As with anything dealing with computers this software is not guaranteed to be 100% effective, but it is continuously being updated to provide the most effective filter possible.
