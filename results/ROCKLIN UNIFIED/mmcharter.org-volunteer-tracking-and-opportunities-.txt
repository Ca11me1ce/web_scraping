Volunteering at MMCA
Parent volunteers play an important role to the success of our school.  
When parents actively participate in their child's school their child benefits. 
Parent Volunteer Hours
We encourage parents to continue their support by being an active participant in their child's education by volunteering 40 hours per family per school year.
We value and encourage families to participate in school events, parent teacher conferences, attend PTA meetings, volunteer their time at school, and other parent enrichment activities provided by the school to inform and encourage parents to be leaders in our school community.
​
There are many volunteer opportunities during school hours, after school, or during the weekend. Volunteer opportunities include helping out in the office, or classroom, on field trips, with our Art Docent Program, Garden Docent Program, or our PTA.  Volunteering and attending school events, PTA general meetings, PTA board meetings,  and/or joining a committee are all ways to earn volunteer hours.
