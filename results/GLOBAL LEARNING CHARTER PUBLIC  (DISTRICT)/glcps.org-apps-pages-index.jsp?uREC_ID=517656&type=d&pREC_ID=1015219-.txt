Health Services
Our School Nurses are an important and valued members of the GLCPS Educational Student Support Team. Offering unique opportunities for students to learn healthy behaviors, and to receive easily accessible health services within a school setting. Our two school nurses are specially trained in health promotion and assessment and respond skillfully to the ever-changing health care needs of today’s students. Using clinical knowledge and judgment, the school nurses provide health care to students and staff, perform health screenings and coordinate appropriate referrals. A student’s health status is directly related to his or her ability to learn. Children with unmet health needs have a difficult time engaging in the educational process. School nurses serve as a liaison between school personnel, family, community and health care providers to ensure that students’ health care needs are met.
