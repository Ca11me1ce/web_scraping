Executive Director's Message
Welcome to the GLCPS website. Please spend some time looking through our pages and getting to know about this special learning community where 95% of our graduates continue on to college. While we're very proud of this, we won't rest until 100% of our students graduate and continue with their education and careers.
This year, the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) renewed GLCPS's charter. After examining our instruction, curriculum, and programs, the Board of Education voted to renew the charter for another five years under the recommendation of Education Commissioner Mitchell Chester.  Now, we are planning for the next five years. 
We hope you enjoy learning more about our award winning school through our website and encourage you to visit us at our two campuses. To arrange a tour please contact the Director of Education and Community Outreach Lynn Poyant at 508-991-4105 x578.
Stephen J. Furtado, Ph.D
