Operating Principles for Education
Education Goal
All DRIHSCS students shall have the opportunity to acquire the following capacities and learning goals:
Communication skills necessary to function in a complex and changing society
Knowledge to make economic, social, and political choices
Understand governmental processes as they affect the community, the state, and the nation
Sufficient self-knowledge and knowledge of their mental health and physical wellness
Sufficient grounding in the arts to enable students to appreciate their cultural and historical heritage
Sufficient preparation to choose and pursue their life’s work intelligently
Skills to enable students to compete favorably with students in other states and other parts of the world
Furthermore, DRIHSCS shall:
Expect a high level of achievement from all students.
Develop their students’ abilities to:
Youth Development Outcome
Description
Learn to be productive
To do well in school, develop outside interest and acquire basic life skills
Learn to connect
To adults in their families and community, to peers in positive supportive ways and to something larger than themselves
Learn to navigate
Youth must find the way around the lures of unhealthy and dangerous behaviors and to handle unfair treatment, rejections and failures
At DRIHSCS, we support a Balanced Assessment System that uses three forms of assessment: Formative Classroom, Interim Benchmark, and Annual Accountability. At the middle school level, we wholly support putting students at the center of learning and engaging them in ways that allow them to assume responsibility for their own success.
Formative Classroom Assessment is an ongoing process used to inform instructional decisions made by the teacher and student. It is linked to the targets of daily instruction, and it provides continuous information. Formative Assessment is what happens when teaching is still underway. Formative Assessment helps shape decisions about what needs to happen next to better prepare students for the summative assessment. This may involve giving students ungraded practice, helping them see where they might improve, or informing teachers on how they might adapt instruction to help move students toward the target.
Interim Benchmark fulfills the traditional role of measuring student progress. Results from tests feed into an evaluation, like a mark in a grade book or a report card. They reflect the level of student learning at a particular point in time.
Annual Accountability Assessment is used to improve future instructional practices in order to improve student achievement. Annual state assessments have an impact on student progression and decisions regarding future programmatic placement.
Components of Academic Grades
Academic grades reflect what the student knows and is able to do. Academic grades must include a minimum of four of the following:
• Cooperative Group Work • Discussion/Problem Solving • Homework • In-Class Assignments • Journals/Logs/Notebooks • Participation • Portfolio (Collection of Content Work) • Projects/Performance Assessments/Presentations • Quizzes and Tests • Student Reflection
Grading policy will be determined by the following guidelines:
Tests: 40%
Homework: 20%
Classwork: 15%
Do now assignments/Quizzes: 10%
Quarterly Project: 10%
Work Ethic: 5%
Conduct/Work Ethic
Conduct grades represent the extent to which the student does the following:
Shows self-control and self-discipline
Respects the rights and feelings of others
Accepts responsibility for his or her own actions
Cooperates in-group activities
Assessment Benchmarks and Transition to High School Standards
Each student must demonstrate satisfactory progress in meeting assessment benchmarks through a school-designed intervention competency modules.
The school will notify the family of the student’s progress toward achieving the standards for promotion and transition from middle school to high school at the end of each school year, sixth through eighth grades. If a student is exhibiting unsatisfactory progress toward meeting the promotion and transition standards by the end of the third marking period, the counselor must notify the family through a personal telephone call, a letter.
Families shall be notified annually of the procedures used to evaluate the academic performance of students. If a student is exhibiting unsatisfactory performance or is experiencing changes in performance, families must be notified in a timely manner prior to the distribution of the progress report or report card.
Student Conferences
Teachers shall be available for conferences requested by students. Teachers may initiate such conferences without a student request when the need is evident.
Family Conferences
Teachers shall be available for conferences requested by families. Reports to families shall include provision for a family member or teacher request for a conference. Such conferences shall be scheduled at a mutually agreeable time.
Homework
DRIHSCS teachers shall approve the assignment of homework as an aid to the program of instruction when such assignments are clear and definite and originate in classroom activities. Teachers will evaluate homework assignments.
Minimum passing Grade: 70
Rationale:
Student Summer Academy Attendance Requirement
Any students receiving below a 3 on any state exam must attend summer school.
