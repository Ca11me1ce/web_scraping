Franklin Wright Settlements
Our building is owned and leased to us by Franklin-Wright Settlements, a key provider of vital programming to families on the East Side. The administration of FWS worked tirelessly with the Boggs School founding team to make their satellite campus, the Sophie Wright Settlement, a warm and wonderful home to our school.
Franklin-Wright prides itself as being the first settlement program established in the state of Michigan. Franklin was founded as a day nursery in 1881 and was privately funded by interested citizens. Two years later, it became incorporated as a day care center and kindergarten. Today, programs include: Youth Enrichment, Recreation, Senior Outreach Services, Early Start Child Care, Family Reunification Services, Mentoring, Counseling and Services resources along with Supplemental Academic Initiatives.
