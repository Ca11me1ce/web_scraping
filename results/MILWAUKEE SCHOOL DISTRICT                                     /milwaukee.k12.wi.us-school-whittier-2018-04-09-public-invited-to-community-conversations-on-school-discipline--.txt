Public Invited to Community Conversations on School Discipline
April 9, 2018
 By 
remshatp
Milwaukee Public Schools (MPS) will host seven Community Conversations throughout April regarding the district’s current disciplinary practices.
MPS is dedicated to making sure each child who steps through the doors of its 160 schools is treated fairly. The Administration has been working with the U.S. Department of Education (DOE) Office of Civil Rights (OCR) regarding a 
resolution agreement
 to clarify the district’s disciplinary policies and to prevent circumstances where there are discipline disparities.
The district has voluntarily entered into this agreement after an initial report from the OCR found disparities in discipline in a sampling of black and white students dating back to the 2014-15 school year. In reaching this agreement, the district acknowledges that it has room to improve its disciplinary practices.
The agreement has several major requirements.
Reviewing and revising the MPS student code of conduct and discipline to improve clarity about what is considered inappropriate behavior and the appropriate range of consequences for those behaviors
Training staff to identify students at risk for behavioral difficulties and using early intervention methods before students are referred beyond the classroom for more intensive disciplinary action
Providing support to ensure that discipline is imposed equitably and fairly across the district regardless of race, gender, religion or national origin
Working with students, staff, families and the community to develop discipline policies and procedures that are fully understood and transparent
Milwaukee Public Schools invites families and the public to attend one of its Community Conversations on discipline. A full list of the sessions is below. Community input is vital to this work.
