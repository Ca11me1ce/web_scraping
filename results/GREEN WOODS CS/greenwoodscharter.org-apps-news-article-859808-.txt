				GWCS PTA Launches an Online Directory			
						Stay Connected with us by registering for our Online GWCS Directory					
Calling all GWCS Families!  We encourage you to join over 100 of your classmates by registering for our online directory! 
MySchool Anywhere is an opt-in online school directory. Think 
about upcoming birthday parties... panicked homework inquiries...
forgotten homework assignments… carpools... summertime play dates...
and other things.  The online directory will make all of the headaches associated with those experiences a thing of the past!
You control your family information! Join our community now at:
