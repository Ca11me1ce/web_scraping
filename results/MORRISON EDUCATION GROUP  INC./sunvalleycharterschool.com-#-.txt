Curriculum
Sun Valley Charter School uses Beyond Textbooks (BT). BT is a curriculum online resource created by a collaborative community of teachers and district leaders to improve student achievement through implementation of proven teaching and learning frameworks. BT is used by over 100 educational partners in Arizona, California, Idaho, Wyoming and Kentucky comprised of 12,000 plus teachers and impacting over 140,000 standards. The BT framework allows for Arizona’s College and Career Ready Standards (AZCCRS) to be paced out throughout the year, making sure all Essential Standards are covered before state testing.
