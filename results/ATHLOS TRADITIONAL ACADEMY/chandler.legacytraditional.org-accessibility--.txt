Accessibility
Legacy Traditional Schools are committed to making our websites accessible to all of its visitors, including those with visual and related disabilities. We have taken a number of steps to improve website access and ensure that those who use a keyboard solely for navigation, require accommodations due to vision impairments, or are using assistive technologies such as screen readers can more easily interact with the content and applications on legacytraditional.org. As guiding principles, we look to accessibility best practices and standards defined by Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act and the web content accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.0).
Key Accessibility features on legacytraditional.org include:
Providing navigation aids for screen reader users
Providing equivalent text for appropriate images and non-visual elements
Providing heading structures for page elements
Using consistent navigation mechanisms and style of presentation throughout the site whenever possible
Identifying row and column headers for data tables
Legacy Traditional School strives to constantly improve website accessibility and welcomes your feedback. If you encounter any concern when accessing the website, please contact us at
