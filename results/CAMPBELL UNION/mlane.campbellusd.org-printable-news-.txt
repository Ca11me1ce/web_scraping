Caterpillar Information
The rapid increased population of 
Western Tussock Caterpillars
has spread worry around the Bay Area as the furry insects can cause rashes if touched, especially in children.  We have seen some of these caterpillars on our campus. We have warned students not to touch them and to report any that they see to an adult.
Though they are native to the Bay Area, experts say that there has been an explosion in caterpillar population, causing hundreds of them to drop from trees in the South Bay prompting calls to the Santa Clara County Agriculture Division.
Though the caterpillars can destroy a lot of leaves and plants, the big concern is the health effects it can have on those around them.
"People want to touch them because they are furry, but the hairs have barbs and if your skin is tender they will get in there and causes a rash on your hand," said Joseph Deviney from the Santa Clara County Agriculture Division.
Bay Area pediatricians have seen several patients with rashes recently but cannot confirm they were caused by contact with the insects.
Experts say the caterpillar population is skyrocketing thanks to an increase in the food supply and a decrease in predators and diseases that kill the critters.
If a child develops an immediate reaction to a caterpillar, it is recommended they remove the tiny hairs with a piece of tape and wash the area. Most reactions go away in a few days but if it seems more serious, parents are to contact their pediatrician.

Testing Reminders
Standardized SBAC/CAASPP testing is beginning on May 1stfor students in 3rdto 5thgrades.  Please remember to have your child to school on time every day having a good night’s sleep and eaten a healthy breakfast.  Students should bring a water bottle to school every day so that can remain well hydrated.  Please do not plan any family trips or non-emergency appointments at this time. It is essential that all students complete all tests.  
Practice Questions
Also, electronics of any kind are not allowed during the assessments. Therefore, teachers will be collecting all cell phones and Apple watches during the testing period.  It would be helpful if these items remained at home from May 1stto May 31stunless your child absolutely needs their devices for after school purposes.
Thank you for partnering with us to assist in educating your child and continually assessing our progress.
