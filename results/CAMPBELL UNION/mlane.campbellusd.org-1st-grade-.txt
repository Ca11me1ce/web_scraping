1st Grade
First-graders extend their knowledge of language arts, learning skills that enable them to read and write more independently. By the end of first grade, students should read proficiently at grade level and have the ability to decode and recognize increasingly complex words accurately and automatically. They also extend their knowledge of mathematics as they learn to add and subtract within 20, develop an understanding of whole numbers and place value within 100, measure and order objects by length, interpret data (with up to three categories), and work with shapes to compose new shapes and partition shapes to create “equal shares” (decompose shapes). Standards-based instruction also includes Science, History-Social Science, Visual & Performing Arts, Health, and more.
