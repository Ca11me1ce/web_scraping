Kindergarten
Kindergarten is for children who will be five years old on or before September 1. Instruction in kindergarten is focused on developing foundational skills that prepare students for success in all content areas and sets the foundation for building skills that lead to success throughout the child’s school years. Students build skills in literacy and oral language comprehension, vocabulary, alphabet knowledge, phonological awareness, and print knowledge. They are introduced to the relationship between numbers and quantities, build a foundation for place value, and describe and model objects in their environment using simple geometric shapes and vocabulary.
