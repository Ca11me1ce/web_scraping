Who is Eligible to Enroll at Leading Edge Academy?
Any student may apply to enroll. Once open enrollment has ended (usually around March of each year) students are taken as space is available. Students who have been expelled from a previous school may not be eligible to enroll.
What Is A Charter School?
A Charter School provides all the opportunities of a private school with none of the cost!  Here are a few reasons why more parents are choosing Charter Schools every year!
 Charter Schools are publicly funded by the state, but are privately managed.
 Charter Schools provide a unique setting for learning that will improve student achievement and make available additional public school alternatives.
 Charter Schools encourage the use of different and innovative teachings methods.
 Decision making and control is returned to the local leadership, teachers and parents.
Is There A Waiting List?
Yes. Students are placed on a waiting list once classes are filled to capacity. Waiting lists are created on a first come – first served basis.
