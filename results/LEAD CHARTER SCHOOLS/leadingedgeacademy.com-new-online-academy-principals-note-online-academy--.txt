Principal’s Note: Mindi Johnson
Greetings Leading Edge parents and students,
I welcome you to the Leading Edge family and community. As the Principal of Leading Edge Academy Online, I am responsible for ensuring that our students receive the best possible education. I am not only committed to helping our students earn their high school diploma, but also preparing them for college and a career.
The Leading Edge Academy Online staff is here to make the school years of your student(s) as successful and educationally challenging as possible. We embrace the opportunity to make a lasting impact on their lives and look forward to celebrating their successes!
We offer many different Resource Center classrooms throughout the valley for students to work from. Each Resource Center has a teacher there to help students as needed and to provide motivation for students to stay on track in their classes. Students are also able to work from home 24 hours a day 365 days a year.
As part of the Leading Edge family, please feel free to share concerns, questions, and successes with our staff. We are here to help ensure that our students have a successful junior high and high school experience and that our families feel supported and part of the educational process.
Thank you for your time and I look forward to your student’s success.
Sincerely,
Mindi Johnson, M.Ed.

Mrs. Shelly Livengood worked for over 30 years in the worker's compensation insurance industry as a claim representative dealing with permanently injured workers. After retiring from that career and spending a few years as a stay-at-home mom, she signed on with Leading Edge part-time in 2015 to assist the growing online school. She enjoys traveling, reading, gardening, shopping, her cabin in the woods and most of all, spending time with her family and two granddaughters. She enjoys investing in the lives of the students.
