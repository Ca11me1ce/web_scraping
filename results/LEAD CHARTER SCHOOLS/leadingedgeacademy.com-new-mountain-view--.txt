Motivated. Focused. College-bound.
These are just a few words to describe the students at Leading Edge Academy Mountain View.  We use best practices in education to prepare our students to succeed as we provide them with a solid academic foundation to fulfill their dreams. But we don’t just teach our students – we prepare them for life. Our character education program grooms our students to be outstanding citizens, and positive character traits are modeled by our professional staff.  Our school is located on two campuses in a safe, college-prep environment.
Leading Edge Academy.  
Leading a Generation to Excellence.
How Are We Different?
At Leading Edge Academy, we combine academic excellence with a passion to know each student and help them succeed in school, character, and life. We care about every student! With small class sizes, a safe, wholesome environment, traditional values, and school uniforms, our campus feels like a private school with the benefits of a public school, such as competitive sports, performing arts, and tuition-free education.

History
Founded in 2002 by Delmer Geesey, a pastor with the vision of starting a top-notch traditional education program, Leading Edge Academy schools began with 17 students. Through word of mouth by satisfied parents, the school began to grow each year. In 2005 The Leading Edge Charter Network took this successful format and expanded to Queen Creek. The Leading Edge Charter Network continues to expand and currently has school sites in Gilbert, East Mesa, Queen Creek, Gilbert and Maricopa.
