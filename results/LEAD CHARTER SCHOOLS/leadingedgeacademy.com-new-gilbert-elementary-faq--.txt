Frequently Asked Questions
What is a Charter School?
A Charter School provides all the opportunities of a private school with none of the cost! Charter Schools are publicly funded by the state, but are privately managed.
Why Charter Schools?
Charter Schools provide a unique setting for learning that will improve student achievement and make available additional public school alternatives. Charter Schools encourage the use of different and innovative teaching methods. Decision making and control is returned to the local leadership, teachers and parents. That’s why more parents every year are choosing Charter Schools.
What makes Leading Edge Academy different from other schools?
Leading Edge Academy is a safe environment where high student achievement is the focus of the school. We provide a rigorous educational program which combines character core values with a special focus on reading, writing and math.
Are your teachers certified?
Our teachers, like all public school teachers, are required to meet the federal standards of Highly Qualified in accordance with the federal laws regarding No Child Left Behind. Although it is not required by the State Department of Education, most of our teachers are also Certified with the State of Arizona.
Are Charter Schools accountable to anyone?
Yes, along with the increased flexibility there is increased accountability. However, instead of being “rule-based” accountable, Charter Schools are “performance based” accountable. The state monitors the outcome, or performance, of students through the state mandated Standardized Testing (currently the AZMerit Test). Leading Edge is accountable to both the State Board of Charter Schools and the Arizona Department of Education. A strenuous annual compliance and fiscal audit is performed each year by a State approved outside audit firm. Leading Edge is also subject to the various fire, health, safety, municipality, local, and federal agencies.
Who is eligible to enroll at Leading Edge Academy?
Any student may apply to enroll. Once open enrollment has ended (usually around March of each year) students are taken as space is available. Students with discipline issues from current schools may not be eligible to enroll.
How can parents become involved?
One of our goals is to foster parental involvement. Parents are encouraged to be involved in the following ways: 
• Develop a close teacher-parent interaction
• Volunteer, when possible, for 1-2 hours per week 
• Participate in Parent/Teacher Organizations 
• Support your children in their homework, assignments, attendance, etc.
• Attend the open Governing Board Meetings
• Support the school financially, especially through the Arizona Tax Credit Program.
What is the cost to attend?
NOTHING! Leading Edge is a Tuition Free public charter school!
Is there a lunch program available?
Yes. Each campus has a catered hot lunch program available for purchase. Additionally, Leading Edge participates in the Government sponsored Free/Reduced Lunch Program.
What are the school days and hours?
Five days a week: Kindergarten to 6th Grade Monday – Thursday 7:50 AM – 2:50 PM; Friday 7:50 AM-11:50 AM; Kindergarten has both a half day and full day program option.
What school calendar does Leading Edge follow?
Leading Edge determines and submits for approval their own calendar each year. It is similar to many of the surrounding school districts, with classes beginning in early August and completing prior to Memorial Day.
What is the dress code? Does the school have uniforms?
Students in K-8th grades wear uniforms. Specific uniform guidelines and dress codes for each campus can be found on the Resources page.
What is the Tax Credit Program?
Leading Edge families benefit from the State of Arizona’s Tax Credit Program. These contributions support extra curricular activities and Character Development Programs while families receive a direct dollar for dollar state tax credit up to $200 for individuals and up to $400 for families filing jointly. Anyone who pays Arizona state tax can give to Leading Edge and receive a tax credit; the donors do not have to have a student attending the school.
What about student transportation and car pooling?
At most campuses parents are responsible for their student’s transportation. The East Mesa campus has limited transportation available beginning with the 2015/16 school year. Also, each year several parents formulate a carpool map and data from the school office is available to assist families interested in car pooling
Does Leading Edge participate in the Standardized Testing?
Our students are administered the current Arizona State  Assessments (currently AZMerit) just like any public school. These are used by the state to determine our school’s performance. In addition, we use several other methods to monitor our students’ progress, including AIMSWeb, Galileo, and other performance measuring instruments.
