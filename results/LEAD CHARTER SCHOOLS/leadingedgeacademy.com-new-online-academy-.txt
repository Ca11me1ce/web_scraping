Online Academy
Campus Overview
Leading Edge Academy Online is part of a network of college-prep charter schools that have a history of academic excellence. Our Online Academy features award-winning curriculum and tuition-free enrollment for grades 6-12!
How Are We Different?
LEAO is an online distance learning program for Middle School and High School.  Work can be completed any time during the day or week.  However, to help students stay on pace, Resource Centers are provided in various locations to support student learning.
Support
At each Resource Center, students are under the supervision of highly qualified professionals to complete core coursework.
Hybrid Instruction
While core classes are completed through online classes, some Resource Centers offer classes such as PE, Art, and Music from live instructors.
Hours
Each student must complete a minimum of 30 hours a week.  Students are able to log in time at the Resource Center or on their own time via the Internet.
History
Founded in 2002 by Delmer Geesey, a pastor with the vision of starting a top-notch traditional education program, Leading Edge Academy schools began with 17 students. Through word of mouth by satisfied parents, the school began to grow each year. In 2012 The Leading Edge Charter Network took this successful format and expanded virtually through Leading Edge Academy Online. The Leading Edge Charter Network continues to expand and currently has school sites in Gilbert, East Mesa, Queen Creek, Gilbert, Maricopa, and Leading Edge Academy Online.
“What a wonderful experience for our high school aged daughter. She has primarily utilized the online program but has taken a regular math class with GEC. She is affected by a chronic illness and is thriving at this school. Thank-you Leading Edge Online!”
-LEOA Parent
“This is our first year with leading edge and I simply can’t tell you how satisfied I am with this school. The staff is fantastic which in turn makes our kids awesome!!”
