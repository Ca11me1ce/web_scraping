History
Founded in 2002 by Delmer Geesey, a pastor with the vision of starting a top-notch traditional education program, Leading Edge Academy began with 17 students. Through word of mouth by satisfied parents, the school began to grow each year. Leading Edge Academy has been ranked “Top 10 Charter School in the Valley” and today the K-12 Gilbert campus is home to over 400 students. The Leading Edge Charter Network has continued to expand and now has school sites in East Mesa, Queen Creek, and Maricopa.
“You can’t be all things to all people but for us, this school has been wonderful. The principal and teachers are open and easy to talk to. They listen to you and really want to be helpful.”
