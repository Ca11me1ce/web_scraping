Lunch
Woodburn School District offers FREE lunch during Spring Break to children ages 1 to 18 years old.  Click on the link below to view the information flyer for time and locations.  The menu is also available to view.
FREE lunches are available for all of our students every day.  The lunches are provided by the neighborhood district school.  Students who would like to have a FREE lunch must let their teacher know, in the morning, when attendance is taken.  Students are also allowed to bring a sack lunch from home. 
Please be aware that there is not an option to refrigerate or microwave any food items brought from home.
We also serve a free breakfast for students from 7:20-7:40 each morning.
***If your student has any food allergies, alternate food items are available.  A note from the student's doctor stating the specific food allergy is required first.  If you have any questions regarding the meal program here at school, please feel free to contact Mrs. Izer in the school office.
