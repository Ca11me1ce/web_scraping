Inclement Weather
The decision to keep school open, to close or to have a delayed opening is based on the ability to safely transport students to and from school. The WOODBURN SCHOOL DISTRICT makes this decision for the entire district.                                              This includes Woodburn Arthur Academy.
The following situations could occur on a bad weather day:
School is Closed - All students stay home.
1 Hour Delay (Late Start) - This allows families to safely transport students after the roads are cleared and the traffic is reduced.  
2 Hour Delay (Late Start)-  This allows families to safely transport students after the roads are cleared and traffic is reduced. 
Early Dismissal - On very rare occasions, we will begin school and then an unexpected storm will cause us to send students home early. We will contact parents and guardians if this happens. 
In the event there is a school closure/delay, all major radio and television stations announce school closures/delays beginning at 6:00 a.m. Listen for the announcement naming the Woodburn School District.  If there is a one hour delayed opening, school will start one hour later than the usual time, which will be 8:50 am. If there is a two hour delayed opening, school will start two hours later than usual, which will be at 9:50 am. If there is a delayed start, remember that all teachers and staff will be experiencing the same weather and transportation conditions and may not arrive at school until later, so please do not bring your child to school until the delayed start time.
