				Spring Music Concert - Monday, May 7th at 6:00pm			
						CLICK on the title above for details about this favorite Spring event.					
Please make plans to join us on Monday, May 7th at 6:00pm for an hour of music, performed by our very own WAA students.Â  The concert will be held in the auditorium of the Mid-Valley Community Church, located in the front of the school campus.
 Students need to arrive by 5:45pm, dressed in their dressy best. The concert is part of their music grade, therefore, students are expected to attend and participate. We delight in seeing our students demonstrate and perform what they have learned.
