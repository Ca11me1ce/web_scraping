Volunteer Opportunities
Volunteering at Woodburn Arthur Academy
Volunteering is a great way to meet other families and to contribute to the school in a significant way. To support the school in achieving our high standards it is important to have volunteers. There are a variety of jobs that fit most schedules, including take-home projects and one-hour projects.
For the safety of our students, ALL volunteers must complete an Arthur Academy background check EACH NEW SCHOOL YEAR along with a Confidentiality Statement. Previous school year background checks are expired.  Background checks from WSD or other agencies cannot be considered or substituted.  The Arthur Academy background check, as well as the Confidentiality Statement, are very simple, one-page forms that must be completed and turned into the school office.  Background checks must be processed at least one full week before volunteering.  Forms are available below for you to print out or, our Office Coordinator, Mrs. Izer will be happy to assist you.  
VERY IMPORTANT REMINDER:  If you think that you will be volunteering at any point during the school year or want to attend field trips, please complete the required forms as soon as possible and return them to the school office as processing usually takes one full week to complete. We appreciate your cooperation with this requirement.
When arriving to volunteer, please sign in at the office and wear a volunteer badge during your time at school.  When finished, don't forget to sign out before you leave. Thank you so much for being willing to help our school. We really value your dedication and generous spirit.
