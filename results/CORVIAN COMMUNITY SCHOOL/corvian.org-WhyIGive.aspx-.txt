Why I give...		
I give because I want to give back for all that Corvian has given us. 
Our daughter has attended Corvian for the last 4 years. And as each year passes, we are more amazed by her quest for knowledge and willingness to learn, her compassion towards her classmates and the world in general and the imagination for what her future holds for her. All of these traits are guided by the environment she is exposed to in school each day including her amazing teachers and staff with engaging attitudes and curriculum, wonderful friends, service and character building activities and the overall culture of caring and involvement.
Our daughter is in the oldest grade in the school. So we are the chartering the way for future classes. We give because we want to ensure that the same positive experiences that we have had, and will continue to have, will pave the way for future generations. We give because we want to make sure that Corvian’s most valuable resources, our teachers, are adequately recognized for their dedication and hard work for our children and to the school. We give because we believe in the core values and support of Corvian and want to see it continue to grow and succeed in the years to come. We give back for all that Corvian has given our daughter.

Corvian impacts everyone differently.  What's your story?            
I give because Corvian reflects the life lessons that we stress at home, building character and confidence.
I've always loved golf, so it was easy for my grandsons to get me to participate in their school's annual golf outing! After spending the day there -WOW- was I impressed by such great people -from the teachers and administration to the parents and volunteers - everyone associated with Corvian! After the outing, I was equally impressed to hear the director tell us that the school is debt free! How can you not get excited about that and level of enthusiasm you see at Corvian? You can feel it as soon as you walk into the school! Since then, I have given directly to the Corvian fund to further support my grandsons and their classmates.  We need a lot more of what is offered at Corvian in our school systems!

I give because Corvian is more than a school, it is a home.
Corvian is more than a school, it is a home for my boys. Within its walls, all developmental aspects of my children are nurtured.  Through Corvian's focus on character, compassion, and serving the community, our boys are learning how to become responsible and caring citizens.  
Corvian has created a safe learning environment where our boys are valued and their love for learning grows. Hands-on learning fills their days and authentic experiences fill their hearts. Their teachers are free to instruct in ways that they learn best, not how someone else thinks every child should be able to learn.  Our family is thankful for each day our boys have the privilege to learn, share, and grow in this exemplary community.
"Childhood is a journey, not a race."

I give because his school experience has given us hope for his future.
Our son has made huge strides since coming to Corvian!  After our first year, he truly became a different little boy.  His attitude and desire to go to school improved, and he found that he enjoyed learning in the environment that Corvian offered.  His school experience has given us hope for his future!  Through my volunteer time at the school, I have had the privilege of seeing first hand the love and encouragement that the teachers provide to our children. Our family is proud and blessed to be part of the Corvian Family!  
Over the past several years, we have given to Corvian because we truly believe that the money we donate is providing a wonderful learning environment for our child. It has never been a question whether or not we should give...we know we are getting so much in return.  The proof comes everyday that our son comes home with a smile on his face and loving school!

I give because i
ndividually, each gift may not seem large enough to make a difference, but when that small gift is added to the whole, it is huge!
Our family gives because Corvian gives us so much. My girls are thriving with excellent, caring teachers in a small, safe environment. The creative curriculum, emphasizing the whole child and integrating all subject areas, makes learning meaningful and fun. We have been at multiple schools before coming to Corvian and while no school is perfect, Corvian comes pretty close! We want to give back, even if it is in a small amount, to help Corvian grow and better serve everyone. Individually, each gift may not seem large enough to make a difference, but when that small gift is added to the whole, it is huge! By giving, we feel fully integrated into the Corvian community. We don’t have large sums to give all at once, but a simple monthly recurring donation via Paypal really adds up in the end. If you do not have a lot extra to give all at once, think about a small recurring monthly donation. Each individual family participating makes our school community stronger, no matter how big or small. We are all so thankful for this school!
I give because our boys are confident, excited to learn, 
and they love school!
Corvian has been very special to us since our oldest son, Asher, started kindergarten.  We were one of the first families when Corvian received its charter status.  We truly feel like this school was created specifically with our boys in mind. Movement breaks, transition time with music, hands-on learning, etc.   Surely, many parents can relate.  Over the past four years, both of our boys have grown so much.  They are confident, excited to learn and they love school!
While there are so many places asking for donations,  we believe Corvian is the BEST place to invest our resources for our children's future.  We are extremely grateful for our school!! 
- Darin and Johnna Watson, parents to Asher & Brock        
We give to Corvian because they give so much back! 
Our two girls love going to school everyday.  We are so thrilled to see them excelling in school and growing to be respectful, caring and well rounded children.  We know that they will not just be taught to pass a test but about life experiences and compassion. It is exciting to see that our values and morals are being carried on during the school day.  As our girls say, we “won the lottery”. and we feel it is so important to support the school in anyway we can. We know that every little bit helps in making Corvian successful and assures the best education that we could ever want for our girls. Keep up the great work!!

I give because I believe in the caring community of Corvian Community School for my daughter and all of the children we serve.
I give because my daughter is my world. My family and I joined Corvian as a private school and have stayed through the years because my daughter has grown socially, emotionally, and academically through the dedicated attention of administration and staff.
My daughter has grown from a shy, kindergartner to a mature and confident fourth grader. Her caring and supportive fourth grade teachers have helped bring out the gifts my daughter possesses helping her to move forward and succeed in this grade and beyond.
We have seen first-hand the benefit of The Basic School. I believe so much in this model that I dedicate my time and efforts to giving the same experiences to all children at Corvian. I give because I believe in the caring community of Corvian Community School for my daughter and all of the children we serve.
