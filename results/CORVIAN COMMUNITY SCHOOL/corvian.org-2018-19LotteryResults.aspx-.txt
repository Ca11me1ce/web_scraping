Registration numbers and lottery results will NOT be given over the phone. Due to overwhelming requests, if you do not know your registration number or have questions about lottery results, we request you email lottery@corvian.org rather than calling the school.
IMPORTANT: Wait list movement throughout the school year is NOT updated online. Online results provide a one time snapshot from lottery night only.
