850 Students

Mission
KIPP University Prep is committed to developing principled and internationally-minded students and equipping them with the skills, knowledge and character to excel in college, serve their communities, and command their futures.
Vision
KIPP University Prep is a school of excellence where the faculty, students and parents are devoted to the goal of every student going to and through college. We embrace the hard work of maintaining a growth mindset and being open-minded because we know others, with their differences, can also be right. We teach the whole student – mind, character, and body – because we are equipping leaders who will command their futures and serve their communities. We know that when each of us personally commits to leaving a place better than we found it we will build a more just world.
