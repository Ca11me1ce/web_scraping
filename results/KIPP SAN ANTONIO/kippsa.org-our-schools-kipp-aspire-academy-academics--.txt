 Academics 
Teaching and Learning is the heart of our work at KIPP. The focus on academics—on ensuring that every student has the skills and knowledge they need to be successful—defines our work. 
Our academic programs are designed to maximize learning time, to honor multiple learning styles, and to promote above-and-beyond academic achievement. Our courses are designed to encourage student progress from year to year and lead to success in high school and in college. Teachers work together to provide engaging activities that inspire creative thinking, challenge students to do more than they think they can, and develop life-long habits such as perseverance and integrity that can be applied in and out of the classroom. Teaching and Learning is the hard work that we come together to do every day at KIPP Aspire.

Assessments
At KIPP San Antonio we use a variety of methods for measuring student learning and growth. Throughout the school year, KIPP students complete assessments designed to help us know how they are doing and how we can best help them expand their learning. Both formal and informal assessments are used to inform instruction and ensure that student needs are addressed. Families receive results of assessments throughout the year and have the opportunity to discuss the results and student progress with teachers during regularly scheduled conferences.
State Assessments
As do all students in public schools in the State of Texas, Aspire students complete state assessments known as STAAR exams. These include: 5th Grade Reading, Math and Science; 6th Grade Reading and Math; 7th Grade Math, Reading, and Writing; 8th Grade Reading, Math, Science, and Social Studies. All students receive instruction throughout the year to ensure the best chance of success on every exam. The Texas Education Agency provides additional resources and information concerning the STAAR assessments at

.
MAP (Measures of Academic Progress)
MAP, or Measures of Academic Progress, is used by KIPP San Antonio schools in grades 1 through 9 to measure student growth in Math, Language, Reading, and Science. KIPP students complete MAP assessments three times each year to determine how they are progressing in each subject area throughout the school year and from one year to the next. Results of MAP assessments taken in the spring of each year are used to set individualized growth targets for the next academic year to ensure that students are continually progressing in each subject area and achieving the growth they need to be ready for college. Because we are committed to helping all KIPP students to and through college, we use the ACT-aligned MAP assessment to help our students expand their college choices and scholarship opportunities. Students receive individualized MAP results related to their growth goals after every test administration and families are encouraged to support students in their work toward achieving their college ready goals.
Graduate Profile
Our Graduate Profile provides a global picture of the expectations for graduates from KIPP San Antonio. The Graduate Profile represents our vision of the skills, knowledge and attributes we believe are necessary for our students to achieve success after graduation – in college and throughout their lives as successful contributors to their communities and families. It serves as a commitment to all KIPP students and alumni, from kindergartners to high school graduates, that we are dedicated to developing the knowledge, habits and characteristics that will best help them fulfill their goal of successfully completing college and commanding their future.
