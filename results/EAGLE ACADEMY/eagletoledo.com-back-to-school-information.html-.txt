Back-to-School Information 2017-2018
Enrollment Forms
Parents who have not yet enrolled their students can click "Enroll" above to submit information to our office.  Please note that some classes may be full; contact the school office for information about openings at specific grade levels.
Parents of students who are returning should already have a completed re-enrollment form on file.  Please contact the school if you did not return a re-enrollment form in the spring.  The re-enrollment form secures an open spot for your child; please be aware that if you did not return your form, there may not be space available for your child at this time.  Students on the waiting list will be enrolled on a first-come, first-served basis when an opening becomes available.
Please ensure that our office has up-to-date emergency contact information for your family and an up-to-date copy of your child's immunization records.
