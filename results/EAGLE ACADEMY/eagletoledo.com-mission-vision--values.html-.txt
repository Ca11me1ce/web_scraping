Our Mission
Our mission is to provide a safe, nurturing and successful educational choice to urban secondary students.  Eagle Academy will prepare students for careers, active citizenship, and post-secondary education, using a combination of a challenging and relevant curriculum in addition to services offered from outside community partnerships.
Our Vision
EAGLE Academy is a safe, multicultural, and academically stimulating environment that prepares students for success within local and global communities.
Our Values
We believe ALL students CAN learn and be successful in school.
Whether or not students are successful depends largely on US.
We accept students where they are at, and provide them with whatever tools they need to move forward.
We believe that as adults we are to model expectations.
We believe in being life long learners.
We believe in building positive relationships with students and families.
We believe in creating balanced, well rounded, responsible individuals.
We believe that no one ever rises to low expectations.
We believe that we ALWAYS must do what is in the student’s best 
interests.
We NEVER give up on students.
