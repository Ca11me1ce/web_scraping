Character Education
Eagle Academy Elementary uses a school-wide Positive Behavior Support (PBS) Team System to promote teamwork, positive behavior, and to teach and reward good character in the classroom and throughout the school.  Each student is assigned to a team (Yellow, Purple, Orange, or Green) and remains on the same team each year, building a sense of belonging and community.  Teams compete to earn team points, which are awarded for demonstrating positive behavior and good character traits.  Team points are calculated weekly, monthly, and yearly to recognize the winning team.  Team rewards include recognition in weekly assemblies, monthly parties with special treats, and end-of-year celebrations and trips.  Team members are encouraged to wear their team shirts (provided for free) on Mondays for weekly Assembly to promote team recognition and unity.  Each month, staff will focus on teaching one character trait, such as respect, honesty, kindness, etc.
