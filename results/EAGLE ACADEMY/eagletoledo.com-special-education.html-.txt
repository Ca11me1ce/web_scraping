Special Education
All students possess unique physical, intellectual and cognitive characteristics which influence learning. Eagle Academy maximizes the potential of all students regardless of ability by providing personalized instruction to all students. Eagle Academy embraces the philosophy that all students can be best educated in the general classroom, making accommodations and modifications as necessary to achieve this.
Inclusion Specialists at the school work closely with teachers to provide individualized education programs for each student. Full implementation of the Individualized Education Plan is provided in the least restrictive environment. Students also benefit from a range of scheduling options and small-group instruction.  Additional student support services are provided by our school  psychologist, speech therapist, and Unison Behavioral Health Group.
Eagle Academy adheres to the three-tiered Response to Intervention model.  All students receive high-quality, whole class instruction at Tier 1.  In addition, students may receive small group instruction at Tier 2 to reach specific learning targets.  Some students may need more individualized support to meet a learning goal, and may receive small group or one-on-one support at Tier 3 for a short period of time.  Most interventions take place within the classroom.  Intervention Specialists, Titile 1, and Paraprofessionals support instruction at all three tiers.  All students are assessed three times per year in Reading and Math and may be assessed more frequently for progress monitoring to ensure that learning targets are being met.  Intervention programs include Project MORE, Phonics First, Accelerated Reader, Reflex Math, PALS Reading, and PALS Math.
