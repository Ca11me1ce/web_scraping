Attendance
The following measures serve as Ohio’s legal definition (HB410) of what constitutes ‘habitual’ and ‘excessive’ truancy.  In addition there is a possibility of filing truancy with the legal system as required by the Ohio Revised Code:
Habitual Truancy
30 or more consecutive hours of unexcused absence from school
42 or more total hours of unexcused absence from school in one month
72 or more total hours of unexcused absence from school in one year. 
Excessive Absence
38 or more consecutive hours of unexcused absence from school in one month
65 or more consecutive hours of unexcused absence from school in one year
If a student qualifies for being ‘habitually truant’ or ‘excessively absent’ Eagle Academy will send a ‘1st Notice’ and ‘2nd Notice’ as each case requires.  The intent of this interaction is to be a type of intervention providing the parent and student the opportunity to explain their circumstances, whereby an appropriate course of action can be determined.  If no one is home, Administration or a designated representative will send the notice via certified mail.  
If a student is labeled as ‘habitually truant’ or ‘excessively absent’ they will not receive the disciplinary measures of out-of-school suspension or expulsion.  Additionally, an ‘Absence Intervention Team’ will develop individual plans to support students and families who have been identified in either or both categories.
   After any absence, a student MUST bring a signed note to school.  The student should present his/her note signed by his/her parent or guardian stating the date(s) of absence, the reason for the absence, and a current phone number.  This note is to be presented to the office.  The school will then place a call to confirm the absence excuse.
Excused Absences
* Death in the   family
* Family illness   (an emergency situation requiring the student to be absent from school)
* Quarantine of   the home by Health Officials
* Head lice (one   day only)
* Personal   illness with doctor’s note
* Long term   personal illness (with proper documentation)
* College visits   (pre-approved by office)
* Documented   court or court ordered activities
Unexcused Absences
* Overslept
* Doctor’s   Appointment (all day)
* Chronic head   lice
* Lack of   transportation/missed the bus
* Vacations
* "Not feeling   well” (no note from doctor)
Absences counted as present
             * Religious   observations (with prior written request)
* Illness   requiring hospitalization
* Doctor/dental   appointment not exceeding 2 hours with prior notification given to the office
Students, who return to school without a note, or with a note missing a signature or current phone number, will have the absence coded as unexcused.
After three (3) consecutive days of absence, a student must have a note from a medical doctor or the absences will be coded as truancy.  However, a period of extended illness (i.e. Chicken pox) may be considered a single absence for this requirement. All absences documented with medical verification notes will be excused.
Withdrawing from Eagle Academy
In order to withdraw, a parent must fill out a withdraw form and returned to the school office. Failure to send a child to school without office notification for 10 consecutive days will trigger review and possible notification of juvenile services.
Early Dismissal 
While we understand that situations may arise, your student’s attendance throughout the school day is very important.  If you need to pick up your child early, please inform the office early in the day. Parents are asked to refrain from habitually picking their child(ren) up early from class, as this results in disruption of the classrooms.
Make up work 
Make up work will only be given for excused absences. It is the responsibility of the students or parent/guardian to contact the school to obtain make up assignments for excused absences.   Students who know when they will be absent should obtain assignments from their teachers prior to being absent.  All absences will be considered by teachers in determining the participation portion of student grades.  Students may receive full credit for work missed during an excused absence as long as the work is completed properly and submitted on time.  Students will have equivalent to the number of days of the excused absence to make up missed work.
 It is up to the discretion of the teacher to accept or refuse work for unexcused absences.
