Dress for the Weather
It's 
cold and winter is here. Please make sure your student is wearing the proper gear for being outdoors. We have outside recess until it hits 20 below. Hats and water resistant gloves or mittens are best, along with snowpants to keep students warm and dry. Scarves help keep the wind off young faces. Safety first.
