   Welcome 
   to the 
Fairbanks North Star Borough 
School District!
Fairbanks North Star Borough School District (FNSBSD) is a military-friendly school district. We want to help make your transition in our schools as smooth as possible and provide you up-to-date information while you are here! 
With more than 13,800 students and 38 campuses in Fairbanks North Star Borough School District, we educate over 3,200 military connected students which is 26% of the total FNSBSD student population 
(current information as of 2-11-2018).
The FNSBSD fully funds, maintains and staffs three elementary schools (Anderson, Arctic Light, Crawford) and one junior/senior high school (Ben Eielson) on base and post.
The FNSBSD was awarded $1.5 million dollars in 2015 by the Department of Defense Educational Activity (DODEA) in a 1:1 iPad grant at five of our elementary schools (Anderson, Arctic Light, Crawford, Ladd and Midnight Sun).
The FNSBSD was awarded $1.5 million in 2016 by the Department of Defense Educational Activity (DODEA) in a Project 360 social emotional grant at ten of our elementary, jr. high/middle, high and our homeschool and online learning program (Anderson, Ben Eielson Jr/Sr High, BEST, Crawford, Midnight Sun, North Pole Elementary, North Pole Middle, North Pole High, Salcha, Ticasuk Brown).
The FNSBSD was awarded $1 million in 2017 by the Department of Defense Educational Activity (DODEA) for DIPLOMAS at five of our jr. high/middle and high schools (Ben Eielson Jr/Sr High, North Pole Middle, Tanana Middle, North Pole High, Lathrop High).
The FNSBSD supports the Child and Youth Behavioral Military & Family Counseling program, funded by the Department of Defense, where seven counselors serve six elementary schools, one junior/senior high school, one middle school and two high schools for students, families and staff.
The FNSBSD participates in the School Partnership Program that links Fort Wainwright units with local schools (Anne Wein, Arctic Light, Barnette Magnet, Ladd, Lathrop, Midnight Sun, Nordale, North Pole High, North Pole Middle, Ryan, Tanana Middle, Ticasuk Brown).
The FNSBSD partners with Fort Wainwright in the annual Back to School Fair.
We would like to take this opportunity to say thank you to our military families, especially our youngest heroes-your children, our students!
