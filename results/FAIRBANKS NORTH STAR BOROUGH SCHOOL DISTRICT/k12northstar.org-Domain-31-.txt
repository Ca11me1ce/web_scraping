Ryan Middle School staff and teachers serve tea to students, who made the Honor/Merit roll for the first three quarters of the school year, and their families. We celebrated the 167 students who made the Honor/Merit roll. There were 94 students on the Honor roll, 37 students held a 4.0 GPA, and 74 students were on the Merit roll. Way to go Wolverines!
