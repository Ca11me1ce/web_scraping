Loop Drive Reminder
We have received many complaints from concerned parents about the drop-off and pick-up procedures. In an effort to have everyone on the same page, here are the procedures.
The speed limit in the loop drive is 3MPH.
The center lane is the Drive-Thru Lane ONLY.
Students are NOT to get in or get of your car into the center lane.
Use of blinkers will signal your intentions when changing lanes.
Students dropped off on the left side of the loop drive will walk to the crosswalk and wait for the crossing guard.
Please follow all directions given by the crossing guard.
These procedures are put in place for the safety of our students. We appreciate all those who are looking out for our students and following the rules.
