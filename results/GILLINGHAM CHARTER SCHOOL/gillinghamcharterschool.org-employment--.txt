Working at Gillingham Charter School is not your ordinary teaching job; it is an opportunity for you to become part of a unique educational approach that prioritizes relationship-building, a growth mindset, and self-education. You will find that the collaborative culture at GCS is rigorous, restorative and respectful.
Teachers who are the most successful at GCS recognize, first and foremost, that a “one-size-fits-all” approach to education doesn’t work for all students. Our teachers are passionate about their students’s education and willing to learn and embrace new methods. This requires innovative, experimental, creative, resourceful, flexible and adaptable minds. To help teachers new to GCS, we provide a full week of immersion in our methods at the beginning of the school year. New faculty are also paired with a seasoned teachers for coaching and mentoring. We also have highly-trained Restorative Practices and Nurtured Heart Approach coaches to support the entire school throughout the year.
How is teaching at GCS different from other schools?
Our class size is capped at 22 students, so our teachers enjoy a smaller, more intimate school setting.
Homeroom teachers eat lunch with their students daily to build community and comradery.
Our students go outside everyday, weather permitting, of course.
Restorative Practices and the Nurtured Heart Approach result in fewer classroom disruptions, and they restore relationships when conflict arises.
GCS is a non-union environment with less red tape. Our directors have an open-door policy and listen to concerns and suggestions to make sure employees' needs are met. Teachers and staff have a voice.
Our school holds engaging monthly activities, such as Evening Collaboratives and Saturday Service Projects, for families and staff to build relationships, to learn together and to make a difference in our community.
We all have our own strengths and weaknesses, and GCS focuses on helping all persons, students and adults, to grow. Hence, once a month students are dismissed early so that the Gillingham team has meaningful time to learn and to collaborate together.
