Behavior Management
Clear. Logical. Empathy. Choice.
Behavior Management
Introduction
Enlace Academy implements a system of logical consequences delivered with empathy as described in the book Teaching with Love and Logic.  In keeping with our academic approach that creates an environment of personalized instruction, we believe that behavior management should be individualized as well.  In our ‘natural consequences’ approach, students learn how their choices affect themselves and others and are taught that mistakes are an opportunity for personal growth.
Core Beliefs
Clear expectations
Clear expectations allow students to work towards positive behaviors and habits.
Choice
Choices allow students to take ownership of their own actions.
Logical Consequences
Students learn to make decisions and live with the consequences of those decisions.
Empathy
Empathy increases the chance that the student will focus on his or her decisions rather than anger towards adults.  Empathy also focuses on emotions such as disappointment, love, and concern rather than tension, frustration, and rage.
