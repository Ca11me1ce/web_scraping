Fostering Character
FOSTERING CHARACTER
Character Education
“The necessity of forming habits is an integral part of [our] philosophy as they aid one in functioning in relationships.  These are not tacked onto one’s life as another feat to be mastered in a performance culture, but are used as valuable tools in intellectual...and physical development.”
-Maryellen St. Cyr, 
When Children Love to Learn
Habits listed are in the order that they are added at the grade levels.  All habits are promoted throughout the school at all grade levels, but certain habits are a focus at each grade level.  The habits are cumulative, and middle school students are responsible for all of habits on the list.  The habits are consistent with the work of Dr. Seligman and Dr. Peterson’s work at the University of Pennsylvania.
Habits beginning in Kindergarten:  
Who am I?
Grit 
- Completing something despite obstacles; a combination of persistence and resilience
Zest - Approaching life with excitement and energy; feeling alive and activated
Curiosity - Taking an interest in experience for its own sake; finding things fascinating
Self-control - Regulating what one feels and does; being self-disciplined
Habits beginning in Third Grade:  
How do I work with others?
Love
 - Valuing close relationships with others; being close to people
Gratitude - Being aware of and thankful for the good things that happen
Integrity - Speaking the truth and presenting oneself sincerely and genuinely
Understanding - Being aware of motives and feelings of other people and oneself
Habits beginning in Middle School:  
How do I contribute to a larger community?
Optimism 
- Expecting the best in the future and working to achieve it
Creativity - Coming up with new and productive ways to think about and do things
Citizenship - Working well as a member of a group or team; being loyal to the group
Open-mindedness - Examining things from all sides and not jumping to conclusions
