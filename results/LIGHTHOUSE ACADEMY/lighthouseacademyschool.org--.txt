Throughout this community, at-risk teens who are expelled, court involved, or who have special education needs face a bleak and uncertain future in our traditional educational system. Now in Kent County, there is a beacon of hope: Lighthouse Academy. Originally opened in January 2005 as a private program and expanding as a charter school in 2008, Lighthouse Academy is a unique and innovative school reaching out to teens who’ve run out of educational options. There are no tuition or enrollment fees. Lighthouse Academy is a unique and innovative school of second chances -- reaching out to teens who have run out of other educational options.
