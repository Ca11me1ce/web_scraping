Careers
As of August 2016, every student in Grades 6–12 is provided with a Chromebook laptop to use while at school and at home. Elementary students (K–5) use either iPads or Chromebooks that remain on campus.
We have made many enhancements to our technology infrastructure in the past two years. In August 2015, we installed a state-of-the-art high-density wireless network. In August 2016, we upgraded all of our network switches and battery backup systems. Our internet connection was upgraded in January 2016 to 250 Mbps as part of the Arkansas Improved State Network for K–12 schools.
Our infrastructure is managed by a collection of about fifteen servers, both physical and virtual, which host critical district services including domain controllers, computer deployment and management, security and access control, and surveillance, as well as cafeteria, library, and print management. We are constantly making plans and implementing changes to better serve our teachers and students.
Chromebook Program
The Device—Lenovo N22 Chromebook
The current device we assign to students in Grades 6–12 is the Lenovo N22 Chromebook. It has 4GB of RAM and 16GB of local storage. Each student has unlimited storage available in their school-provided Google account.

Policies and Procedures
Students are expected to be good digital citizens. The following policies and procedures are relevant to the Chromebook program. The first is only for students who take the devices home (Grades 6–12). The other two are applicable to all students K­–12.

Insurance Option
Our device is built to be used by students. It has very few moving parts under the hood and should stand the test of time. However, we know that sometimes accidents happen. That is why we wanted to provide parents with an insurance option.
$20 will cover your student’s take-home Chromebook for the entire school year. This provides protection against accidental damage and theft. Examples of accidental damage include cracked screens, liquid damage, and drops. More information on the insurance is provided below. Checks can be made to Arkansas Arts Academy.
