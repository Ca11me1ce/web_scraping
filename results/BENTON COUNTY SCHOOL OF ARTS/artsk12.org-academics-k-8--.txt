K-8
The Arkansas Arts Academy’s K–8 program is exploding with artistic and academic awareness.  The K–8 teaching staff serves the community through the lessons that artists teach us about observation, creativity, persistence, and expression. Our K–8 program is focused on acquiring excellence in critical thinking and problem-solving skills through arts-integrated learning.
We expand our classroom beyond the walls of the school on a daily basis with our museum initiative program. We match the collections of area museums to the curriculum in order to experience learning more deeply.  All of this is preparation for a high school experience that embraces art.  We want to meet the community’s needs, offering a path to careers in the arts as well as lifelong learning through the arts.
