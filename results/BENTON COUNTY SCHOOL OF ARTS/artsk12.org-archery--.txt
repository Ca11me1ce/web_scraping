Archery
The fourth- through eighth-grade students participate in the Arkansas National Archery in the Schools Program. We believe that archery is a great way to sharpen skills, build self-esteem, and create a stronger atmosphere in the school. Students learn concentration and hand-to-eye coordination. Students compete in three ANASP tournaments each fall and a fourth tournament when they qualify for the state.
