Piano
Piano class is an exciting addition to the curriculum at Arkansas Arts Academy.  Over 60 students signed up in the first year.
The piano program is designed with flexibility in mind, using a series of drills, exercises, repertoire, and multi-media that allows beginners and those with a piano background to work in the same class.
Piano playing consists of common sense, heart and technical resources. All three should be equally developed. Without common sense you are a fiasco, without technique an amateur, without heart a machine. The profession does have its hazards.
