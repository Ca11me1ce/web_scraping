Mountain Biking
The Arkansas High School Cycling League was organized in 2014, and Arkansas Arts Academy was the first public school to sign on. We offer an after-school mountain bike team for grades 6–8 at the K–8 Campus. At the high school level, we offer mountain biking as a part of the regular school day.
Our season runs from July 1 to Thanksgiving each year. On weekends, both teams practice together on local trails to sharpen their skills. We participate in four to five tournaments sanctioned by the National Interscholastic Cycling Association (NICA) on various mountain bike trails around Arkansas.
Our league is open to both male and female athletes, and students of all abilities—from the beginner to the expert rider. The safety of our student athletes is our number one priority.
We are committed to the NICA’s Five Core Principles: inclusivity, equality, strong body, strong mind, strong character. Our overall goal is to create life-long cyclists who are conscientious, responsible, and empowered.
