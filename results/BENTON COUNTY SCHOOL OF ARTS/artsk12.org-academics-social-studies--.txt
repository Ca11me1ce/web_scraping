Social Studies
The social studies department at Arkansas Arts Academy High School is pleased to offer a full range of courses in which we explore the world and how it works.
Our standards not only exceed state graduation requirements but are also higher than other secondary schools. We cover early American history, contemporary American history, and world history. We also facilitate students’ knowledge in civics, American government, and economics.
Students may increase their opportunities for college scholarships and college success by taking advantage of our Advanced Placement (AP) social studies classes. Arkansas Arts Academy social studies graduates are quite competitive in post-secondary schools.
