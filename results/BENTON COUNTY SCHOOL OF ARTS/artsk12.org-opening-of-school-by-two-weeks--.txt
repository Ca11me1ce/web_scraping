Opening of school delayed by two weeks
May 2, 2018
May, 2, 2018
Dear Students, Parents, Staff,
Our Administration team had a detailed meeting with contractors today on the completion of the new high school. It was ambitious for us to ask them to accomplish what was slated as a two-year project in fourteen months. Although they are close to completion they have asked us to delay the opening of school by two weeks. We respect all of their reasons and the great work they have done on our behalf. The 2018 -2019 school year for both campuses will begin Wednesday, August 15th. Teachers will begin on August 6th.
To make up the ten day delayed opening we will only have a one week break in October and a one week break April/May. In October Students will have a break October 8-12th. In April/May the break will be April 29 – May 3rd.
Please accept my apologies for the change in the calendar and if you have any questions my direct number is 479-877-1795.
Aspire, Achieve, Advance,
Mary Ley
CEO
Arkansas Arts Academy
