Careers
Through three years of partnering with Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, we recognized the opportunity to explore further potential with other museums to increase cross-discipline integration.  Northwest Arkansas is rich in heritage and support for learning centers and museums.  Using Crystal Bridges as our flagship partner and extended classroom, we are establishing connections to the diverse resources and experiences offered by collections housed in local historical, natural, and science museums or sites.  Building students’ awareness of the variety of museums and not-for-profit careers is an integral part of this initiative.
Museums currently include:
Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art
Amazeum Children’s Museum
Pea Ridge Military Park
Rogers Historical Museum
Museum of Native American History
Peel Mansion
Compton Gardens
Shiloh Museum of Ozark History
Walmart Museum
