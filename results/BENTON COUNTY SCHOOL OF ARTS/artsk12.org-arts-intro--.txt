Arts
At Arkansas Arts Academy, we recognize that our students have inherent gifts and abilities unique to each individual. For this reason, the basis of student learning will be formed by the acknowledgement, exploration, and development of these talents within an environment of continued cultivation of self-awareness and community consciousness.
We are here, you are here…. Together we are breaking new ground in a world-class arts education program! With outstanding faculty in numerous visual and performing arts areas, we are moving ahead in expanding these offerings and providing many soon-to-be announced new programs.
Come join this evolution in arts education!
Success occurs in clusters. As artists, we must find those who believe in us, and in whom we believe, and band together for support, encouragement, and protection.
