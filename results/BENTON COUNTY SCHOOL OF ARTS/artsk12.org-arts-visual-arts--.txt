Visual Arts
The Visual Art Department is honored to give our students an education grounded in visual fundamentals, critical thinking and creative expression. Art Education is a vital part of the creative and cultural development of a maturing individual, and for this reason, we encourage problem solving and creativity throughout the students’ growth in knowledge, skills, and talents.
The classes offered are designed to introduce new students to basic and essential art knowledge and skills, allow all students to explore new techniques and create art that deepens their talent level, and finally, allow the more mature artists to work independently with guidance and an eye to their future in the art world.
2-D
As a student in Two-Dimensional (2-D) Art at Arkansas Arts Academy, basic principles of design are learned including, line, shape, perspective, spatial relationships, light/dark contrast, shading, color theory, balance, and overall composition. These elements of design are, then, explored through the implementation of principles of design: unity/variety, proportion, balance, rhythm, and subjective foci. The student learns the substantive methods and materials that will foster and enable him/her on to further visual arts exploration.

As a student in Three-Dimensional (3-D) Art at Arkansas Arts Academy, two-dimensional principles are carried forth through the use of three-dimensional space planning, exploration, and realization. Various media/materials are implemented in these programs, including paper, synthetics, natural materials, and ceramics. Our three-dimensional art program encourages further growth of imagination through creative use of space and design.

GRAPHIC + DIGITAL + ANIMATION ARTS
The Graphic+DIgital+Animation Arts program at AAA offers students a chance to learn the industry standard software used to make major motion pictures as well as build major brand campaigns. During the class, students us project-based learning to follow assignments as well as experiment on their own with tutorials and instruction via online resources. This is the perfect class to help students with the digital art aspect of their portfolio when applying for college. This is a key component to any graphic arts college application. In the end, students will have a short video of all the work they did during the year as well as a solid understanding of the industry and which discipline they’re interested in. They will have a head-start on realizing their dream!
Animation offers a medium of story telling and visual entertainment which can bring pleasure and information to people of all ages everywhere in the world.

Computers don’t create computer animation any more than a pencil creates pencil animation. What creates computer animation is the artist.
