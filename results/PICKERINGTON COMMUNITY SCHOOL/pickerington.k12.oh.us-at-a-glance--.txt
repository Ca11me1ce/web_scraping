Our History
The legacy of the Pickerington Schools begins with the Ordinance of 1785. This ordinance set aside land for school purposes. At one time, Violet Township was home to 19 one- to two-room schools spread across the township. The bulk of these schools later combined and became the Pickerington Local School District.
The first documented school in the Pickerington area was in 1812. It is believed that the log cabin may have been used for church on Sundays and for school during the week.
In 1815, Abraham Pickering, whom the City of Pickerington is named after, donated a plot of land to be used for educational purposes. The Pickerington School House was built on this land. In 1883, a new two-story, two-room school was built to replace the original building.
Census data shows that in 1895 there were 106 students in Pickerington. Today, the original school site is home to the Pickerington and Violet Township Historical Society at 15 E. Columbus Street.
The Violet Township Board of Education was created in 1905 as the first step in the unification of the area schools. After two years of hard work, a charter from the state was in hand, and the process for financing a building program was in place. Construction of the new Violet Township High School (VTHS) began in February of 1907. The building would have six rooms plus a basement at a cost of $15,000. The VTHS class of 1909 was the first to graduate from this new school with a graduating class of four.
In 1939, Violet Township Schools became Pickerington Local Schools and VTHS became Pickerington High School a year later.
Driven by a dynamic and caring staff, Pickerington Local Schools has grown from a shared one-room school in a log cabin to 14 modern facilities educating more 10,000 students.
2015 Community Perception Survey
The majority of Pickerington Schools residents believe the district is headed in the right direction, approve of the job classroom teachers are doing to educate students, and perceive the quality of education being offered as excellent or good.
These are just a few of the results from the school district’s February 2015 resident perception survey. This is the first such survey performed in the district since 2010.
Presentation to the Board of Education
Detailed survey results (RTF)
Regarding the quality of education the district provides, 87.5 percent of respondents said the district is doing an excellent or good job.
Fully 72 percent of those who expressed an opinion approve of the job Pickerington teachers are doing to educate children. This number increases dramatically to 86.7 percent approval among households that have children in Pickerington Schools.
According to the survey results, almost two-thirds of residents said the district was headed in the right direction. About 15 percent of respondents had no opinion.
Information from community perception surveys is used in a variety of ways. The board and administration assess the data when setting future priorities. Perception surveys also allow the district to gauge how its communities view its progress over time.
A few other numbers that stood out in the research include:
80.6 percent said the district is doing an excellent or good job offering classroom technology.
78.1 percent said taxpayers are getting a good value for its investment.
85.0 percent rated the condition of the district’s schools as excellent or good.
82.7 percent rated the condition of the district’s athletic facilities as excellent or good.
74.0 percent said the district is doing an excellent or good job of offering challenging course options.
Numerous questions in the survey were designed to assess what district residents think Pickerington Schools’ top priorities should be. Top priorities from this survey included improving academic performance, increasing STEM (science, math, engineering and technology) education, expanding learning technology, and improving building safety and security.
Paul Fallon Research performed the phone survey in February 2015. The firm interviewed 300 randomly selected district residents. Some adjustments were made to ensure the pool of respondents reflected the demographics of the district, including the percent of households with children in schools, age, race and political affiliation. The sampling error is 5.65 percent.
