Educational Partners
Eastland Fairfield Career Center
Eastland-Fairfield Career & Technical School District
 programs are open to all eleventh and twelfth grade students within our district who demonstrate the ability and interest to attend.
Students remain enrolled in and still graduate from this school and are encouraged to continue participation in our high school extracurricular activities.
With programs on two campuses and five satellite locations, Eastland-Fairfield is closer than you think. Satellite programs are offered at Gahanna, Groveport Madison, New Albany, Pickerington North, and Reynoldsburg High Schools.
Career center website
Innovation Generation
The 
Innovation Generation initiative
 gives Central Ohio high school students the access they need to develop skills that are essential for today’s fastest-growing jobs. In Pickerington Schools, this has resulted in two programs: 
health careers
 and 
advanced manufacturing and robotics.
As part of Central Ohio’s Pathways to Prosperity Network — a network established in nine states — IG assembles high school, college and work-based experiences so that students graduate with economically viable career credentials. In addition, students get a head start on post-secondary studies. Preparing today’s students for postsecondary success is important to us and to Ohio’s workforce.
YMCA Latchkey and Preschool
The 
Jerry L. Garver YMCA
 of Fairfield County offers both a latchkey program and local preschool program.
