Breakfast Menu                                                  Lunch Menu
Our students receive a well-balanced breakfast and lunch. Our food program tries to meet the needs of the children, as well as meet the state and
federal guidelines. We believe that when children are not hungry, they can focus better and strive harder. We believe that by taking away one obstacle, it empowers them to be able to overcome others. We don't only want to feed their bodies, but their minds as well. We want our children to feel as though this is their kitchen; where they are heard and fed; where they learn that their voice matters. Our food program is more than just feeding bellies, it's feeding souls.

Privacy Act Statement:
The Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act requires the information on this application. You do not have to give the information, but if you do not, we cannot approve your child for free and reduced price meals. You must include the social security number of the adult household member who signs the application. The social security number is not required when you apply on behalf of a foster child or you list a Food Stamp Program, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Program, or Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR) case number or other FDPIR identifier for your child or when you indicate that the adult household member signing the application does not have a social security number.

WE MAY share your eligibility information with education, health, and nutrition programs to help them evaluate, fund, or determine benefits for their programs, auditors for program reviews, and law enforcement officials to help them look into violations of program rules.
