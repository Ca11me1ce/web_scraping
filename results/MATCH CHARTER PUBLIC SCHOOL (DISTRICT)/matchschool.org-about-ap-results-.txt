AP Results
Participation in AP courses and success on AP exams are revered academic metrics at Match. In our view, AP coursework and success are true measures of college readiness.
Upperclassmen at Match High School are achieving outstanding results on AP examinations. The graph below covers all charter high schools and district non-exam high schools in Boston. The Y-axis plots high schools by the percentage of students who are high need. The X-axis plots schools by an AP success index. The index is the product of the rate at which students participate in AP exams and the rate at which they pass those exams.

A student is classified as economically disadvantaged if she qualifies for food stamps, Medicaid, or certain other public subsidies.&amp;nbsp;  "  />
