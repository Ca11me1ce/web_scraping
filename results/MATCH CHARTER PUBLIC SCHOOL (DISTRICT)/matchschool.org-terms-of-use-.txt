6.    Limitation of Liability and Disclaimer of Warranties.
6.1    MATCH, ITS AFFILIATES, THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS, OR LICENSORS (COLLECTIVELY, THE “MATCH PARTIES“) MAKE NO WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS ABOUT THE CONTENT, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ITS ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, COMPLETENESS, TIMELINESS, OR RELIABILITY.  THE MATCH PARTIES SHALL NOT BE SUBJECT TO LIABILITY FOR THE TRUTH, ACCURACY, OR COMPLETENESS OF THE CONTENT OR ANY OTHER INFORMATION CONVEYED TO THE USER OR FOR ERRORS, MISTAKES, OR OMISSIONS THEREIN OR FOR ANY DELAYS OR INTERRUPTIONS OF THE DATA OR INFORMATION STREAM FROM WHATEVER CAUSE.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU USE THE WEB SITES AND THE CONTENT AT YOUR OWN RISK.
THE MATCH PARTIES DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE WEB SITES WILL OPERATE ERROR FREE OR THAT THE WEB SITES, THEIR SERVER(S), OR THE CONTENT ARE FREE OF COMPUTER VIRUSES OR SIMILAR CONTAMINATION OR DESTRUCTIVE FEATURES.

THE WEB SITES AND CONTENT ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. THE MATCH PARTIES DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, NON INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTIES’ RIGHTS, AND FITNESS FOR PARTICULAR PURPOSE. 
6.2    IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY MATCH PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, INCIDENTAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS, OR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM LOST DATA OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) RESULTING FROM THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE WEB SITES AND THE CONTENT, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, EVEN IF SUCH MATCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.” If you are a resident of another jurisdiction, you waive any comparable statute or doctrine.
8.    Termination of the Agreement.

Any suspected fraudulent, abusive or illegal activity that may be grounds for termination of your use of Web Sites and services, may be referred to appropriate law enforcement authorities. Match may also in its sole discretion and at any time discontinue providing the Web Sites, or any part thereof, with or without notice. You agree that any termination of your access to the Web Sites under any provision of this Agreement may be effected without prior notice, and acknowledge and agree that Match may immediately deactivate or delete your account and all related information and files in your account and/or bar any further access to such files or the Service. Further, you agree that Match will not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your access to the Service.
8.2 Sections 2 (Access and Use of the Web Sites), 6 (Limitation of Liability and Warranty), 7 (Indemnification), 8 (Termination of the Agreement), 13 (Your Privacy) and 14 (Miscellaneous) shall survive the termination of this Agreement.
