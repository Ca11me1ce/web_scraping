About MMS
Match Middle School (MMS) opened in the fall of 2008 with a 6th grade class and has grown into a full middle school with grades 6 through 8. Its students are selected in a blind lottery process and come from neighborhoods throughout the Boston area. At MMS, our students begin the process of fulfilling the Match Mission: preparation for success in college and beyond.
