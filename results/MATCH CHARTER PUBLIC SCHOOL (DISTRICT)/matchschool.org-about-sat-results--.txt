SAT Results
All Match upperclassmen take the SAT in high school, and their success on the test is impressive.
In 2015-16, our high school upperclassmen averaged 1372 on the SAT, a result that is near the national average and well ahead of their peers in Boston's non-exam high schools, where the average SAT score was 1136.
The graph below plots all charter high schools and district non-exam high schools in Boston. The Y-axis plots schools by the percentage of students who are high need. The X-axis plots the schools' average SAT score.
