Opportunities for Tutors and Aspiring Teachers at Match
Match offers several distinct opportunities for folks who are relative newcomers to our work in education reform:
Match Corps is a one-year urban education fellowship.  Match Corps Members tutor small groups of students in grades 6-12 and partner closely with families. Tutors are integral members of high-performing school teams in some of the best schools in America and discover what it takes to change the lives of kids.  For more information about Match Corps, click

.
The Match Teacher Residency (MTR)  prepares recent college graduates and career changers to serve as highly effective first year teachers in charter schools and turnarounds.  MTRs serve as members of the Match Corps.  In addition to their responsibilities for Match Corps, they complete coursework, simulated teaching, and student-teaching through the Sposato Graduate School of Education.  With support and training from Sposato, 100% of MTRs have obtained full-time teaching jobs over the last 10 years.  For more information about MTR, click 
here
.
The Match Associate Teacher Program prepares candidates with 1-2 years of prior student-facing experience to serve as highly effective first year teachers in charter schools and turnarounds.  MATs are placed on grade-level (K-5th) or subject level (6th-12th) teams in Match Public Charter Schools for an intensive, year-long apprenticeship. Throughout the year, our associate teachers are coached and mentored by leaders and teachers at Match and slowly take on more classroom responsibilities.  MATs also complete coursework and simulated teaching through the Sposato Graduate School of Education.  For more information about the MAT program, click
