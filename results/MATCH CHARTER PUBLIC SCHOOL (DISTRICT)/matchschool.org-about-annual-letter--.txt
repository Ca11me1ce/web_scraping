2015–2016 Match School Results
Dear Friends of Match Education,
I am writing to share our school results for the 2015–16 school year.  We had an outstanding year, and as ever the credit goes to our students, staff, teachers and tutors who work so hard every single day.
We have one of the lowest student attrition rates of any public school in Boston.
Our students mirror, in background and need, the students of Boston Public Schools (BPS).
Our students thrived on the PARCC in grades 3-8, on the MCAS in grade 10, and on the AP and SAT in grades 11 and 12.
Graduates from our high school continue to enter and finish 4-year college at exceptionally high rates.
Thank you for your belief in Match Education. Come by and visit any time.
All the best,
Stig Leschly
CEO, Match Education  
INDICATOR 1: Student Attrition
Match has one of the lowest student attrition rates of any public school in Boston
With enormous dedication, we seek to serve and keep all students who enter Match Charter Public School, no matter their background, level of need, or year of entry. We are genuinely proud to have one of the lowest attrition rates of any district or charter school in Boston. In 2015-16, a modest 11% of our student body, PreK-12, transferred during the school year or over the summer.  This compares favorably to almost all public schools in Boston.
The graph below compares the attrition rates of every public school in Boston. "School year attrition" is the percent of students who transfer during the academic year, and "summer attrition" is the percent of students who transfer during the summer.

INDICATOR 2: Demographics
Demographics at Match and BPS are Similar
Our school serves high-need students typical of Boston Public Schools (BPS).  93% of Match students are African-American or Hispanic, and they are as likely as the general BPS population to be English Language Learners (ELL), special education students, and from low-income households.  Students gain acceptance to our schools via blind public lotteries open to all Boston residents.

INDICATOR 3: PARCC / MCAS Results
our students thrived on parcc and mcas
The tables below show the rates at which our students reach proficiency on PARCC and MCAS tests in English and math in grades 3-8 and 10.
Our PreK-12 school has been expanding rapidly over the past few years and, in growing, has been accepting students across our grade level span. As a result, the tenure at Match of a given class varies significantly. For example, when they tested in 2015-16, students in our 3rd and 10th grade classes had been at Match for 5 years in most cases. By contrast, in 2015-16, students in grades 4-8 had been at Match for much shorter periods, ranging from 1 to 3 years.
We will reach full enrollment in PreK-12 over the next two years and, once we do, will admit students mainly in early elementary school and serve them through the entirety of their PreK-12 career. Our long-term goal, once our enrollment stabilizes and once we have our students for long periods of time, is to reach a point where 90% of students pass standardized exams in all grades and subjects.

INDICATOR 4: SAT
Match students leading the way on the SAT
All Match upperclassmen take the SAT in high school, and their success on the test is impressive.
In 2015-16, our high school upperclassmen averaged 1372 on the SAT, a result that is near the national average and well ahead of their peers in Boston's non-exam high schools, where the average SAT score was 1136.
The graph below plots all charter high schools and district non-exam high schools in Boston. The Y-axis plots schools by the percentage of students who are high need. The X-axis plots the schools' average SAT score.

INDICATOR 5: Advanced Placement
Match students succeed on Advanced Placement Exams
Participation in AP courses and success on AP exams are revered academic metrics at Match. In our view, AP coursework and success are true measures of college readiness.
Upperclassmen at Match High School are achieving outstanding results on AP examinations. The graph below covers all charter high schools and district non-exam high schools in Boston. The Y-axis plots high schools by the percentage of students who are high need. The X-axis plots schools by an AP success index. The index is the product of the rate at which students participate in AP exams and the rate at which they pass those exams.

INDICATOR 6: four-YEAR COLLEGE enrollment and completion
MATCH ALUMNI ARE enrolling in and completing 4-YEAR COLLEGE AT RECORD RATES
Each year for the last decade, Match has sent 80% - 90% of our high school graduates to 4-year colleges and 5% - 10% of our high-school graduates to two-year colleges. We currently have firm college completion data on our high school graduates from 2004 to 2010, all of whom have been given six years to finish 4-year college.
Among these six early graduating classes from our high school, 51% have completed a 4-year degree and 87% enrolled in a 4-year college. In these early cohorts, an additional 10% of the high school graduates are still enrolled in a 4-year college and might still earn a degree, and 4% have obtained a 2-year degree.
Our early college completion results are similar to recently released college-completion results at KIPP, YES Prep, and other national high-performing charter organizations. And, as the chart below makes clear, our college results are far ahead of the norm for low-income high school graduates nationally.

Notes and Sources
Definitions common across indicators:
Economically disadvantaged:
 This measure replaces the “free/reduced” measure that DESE previously reported. A student is defined as economically disadvantaged if the student participates in one or more of the following state-administered programs: the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP); the Transitional Assistance for Families with Dependent Children (TAFDC); the Department of Children and Families' (DCF) foster care program; and MassHealth (Medicaid). According to DESE, “Because of this change in methodology, the number of ‘economically disadvantaged’ students reported as enrolled on October 1, 2014, in most schools will be lower than the number of ‘low income’ students reported in 2013-14 and prior years. It is important for users of this data to understand that enrollment percentages and achievement data for ‘economically disadvantaged’ students cannot be directly compared to "low income" data in prior years.”
High Needs:
 As defined by DESE, a student is defined as “high needs” if the student falls into at least one of the following categories: economically disadvantaged, English Language Learner, student with a disability.
Exam schools: 
In Boston, the following public schools select students based on GPA and performance on a standardized test and are categorized as “exam schools:” Boston Latin Academy; Boston Latin School; John D. O’Bryant School of Math & Science.
District Non-Exam:
 All public district schools except for the exam schools listed above and the following schools: Carter Developmental Center, Horace Mann School for the Deaf, Boston Middle School Academy, Boston Adult Academy.  In-district charter schools such as Boston Day and Evening Academy, Dudley Street Neighborhood Charter, and UP Academy are included here.
Notes on individual indicators:
Indicator 1: Attrition – 
School year attrition represents the complement of the school-level stability rates reported on the DESE website (http://profiles.doe.mass.edu/state_report/mobilityrates.aspx
).
  According to DESE, “School-level stability is based on the students enrolled in a public school, as reported by districts in the October data collection, who are enrolled in the school throughout the year, as reported by districts in the March and End of Year data collections.”  Summer attrition represents the school-level summer attrition data reported on the DESE website (http://profiles.doe.mass.edu/state_report/attrition.aspx).
Indicator 2: Demographics – 
All data are from 2015-16 as reported on the Selected Populations report on the DESE website (http://profiles.doe.mass.edu/state_report/selectedpopulations.aspx).  Data reported for Match reflect the PreK-12 student body.
Indicator 3: Student Achievement –
 PARCC data reflect the performance of students in grades 3-8 as reported by DESE(http://www.doe.mass.edu/parcc/results.html).  Students are considered “proficient” if they score a 4 or 5 on PARCC. For grade 10, data reflect performance on the MCAS exam.
Indicator 4: SAT –
 All SAT data are based upon the publicly reported DESE data for 2015-2016 (http://profiles.doe.mass.edu/state_report/sat_perf.aspx).  According to DESE, these data include all students reported to have graduated in 2016 and reflect the student’s most recent SAT score as reported by the College Board.
Indicator 5: Advanced Placement – 
All AP data are from 2015-16 as reported on the Advanced Placement Performance and Advanced Placement Participation sections of the DESE website (http://profiles.doe.mass.edu/state_report/ap.aspx; http://profiles.doe.mass.edu/state_report/ap_part.aspx).  The pass rate is computed as the percent of total tests taken that yielded a score of 3-5.  The participation rate is computed as the total number of unique test takers divided by the total number of juniors and seniors enrolled in the school according to the 2015-16 DESE enrollment report (http://profiles.doe.mass.edu/state_report/enrollmentbygrade.aspx).  The metric graphed here is AP pass rate * AP participation rate, an index that reflects overall AP participation and success in a given school.  All Boston Public Schools where students take AP exams are included here except the Margarita Muniz Academy, which is excluded due to its status as a dual language school where nearly all students take only the AP Spanish Language exam.
Indicator 6: College Success Among High School Graduates – 
Match data are based on data from the National Student Clearinghouse as well as internal tracking of alumni.  National data are based on the following research study: Mortensen, Tom. “Bachelor’s Degree Attainment by Age 24 by Family Income Quartiles, 1970 to 2009.” Accessed at www.postsecondary.org.
