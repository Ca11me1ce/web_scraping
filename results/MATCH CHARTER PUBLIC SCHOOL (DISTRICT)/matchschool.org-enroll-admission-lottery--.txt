“There is a very strong sense of community, of family.  We spend most of the day, most of the week here.  We get used to other people’s strengths and flaws.  We’ve watched each other grow, get taller.  We’re like sisters and brothers.”

Match Charter Public School (Match) is a free, public school in Boston. We urge all families in the city of Boston to submit an application in our lottery.
We select students through a random public lottery.
Match serves grades K1 through 12th. Students who are not accepted in the lottery will be placed on a waiting list and will remain on that waiting list until the next lottery.
A child must reside in Massachusetts in order to enter the lottery. Children who reside in Boston receive preference in the enrollment lottery, as do siblings of current students. 
Match does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, creed, sex, gender identity, ethnicity, sexual orientation, mental or physical disability, age, ancestry, athletic performance, special need, proficiency in the English language or in a foreign language, or prior academic achievement when recruiting or admitting students.
