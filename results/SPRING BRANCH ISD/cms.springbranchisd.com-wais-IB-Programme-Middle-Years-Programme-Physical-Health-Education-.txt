IB MYP Physical and Health Education
Physical and health education focuses on both learning about and learning through physical activity. Both dimensions help students to develop approaches to learning (ATL) skills across the curriculum. Physical and health education contributes a unique perspective to the development of the attributes of the 
IB learner profile, promoting the health of individuals and communities. 
Through physical and health education, students can learn to appreciate and respect the ideas of others, and develop effective collaboration and communication skills. P & HE also offers many opportunities to build positive interpersonal relationships that can help students to develop a sense of social responsibility. At their best, physical and health education courses develop the enjoyment, engagement and confidence in physical activity that students need in order to achieve and maintain a balanced, healthy life.
Physical activity and health are of central importance to human identity and global communities. They create meaningful connections among people, nations, cultures and the natural world, and they offer a range of opportunities to build intercultural understanding and greater appreciation for our common humanity.
The MYP structures sustained inquiry in physical and health education by developing conceptual understanding in global contexts. Global contexts direct learning toward independent and shared inquiry into our common humanity and shared guardianship of the planet. Using the world as the broadest context for learning, MYP physical and health education can develop meaningful explorations of:
• identities and relationships
• orientation in space and time
• personal and cultural expression
• scientific and technical innovation
• globalization and sustainability
• fairness and development.
