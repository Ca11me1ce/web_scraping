9th Grade
Welcome Wildcats! Some of you started with us in 6th grade, others are brand new to our campus and the IB Middle Years Programme. Depending on where you attended middle school, your first year in upper school at WAIS may take some getting used to. Like in our middle school, you will be assigned to one of two teams of teachers; House A and House B. These teachers make up the traditional Texas Core classes in your schedule. You will still have several other teachers in the other subject groups. To find contact information for your other teachers, check the appropriate page in the department section of our faculty.
