Celebration of Learning: Literary Cafe
		1/5/2017				
		0 Comments	
What's a literary cafe?  It's a calm, coffee shop atmosphere in which readers and writers take turns sharing their writing and excerpts from their favorite books.
Each fifth grader will be performing a dramatic reading related to the novel we read this quarter: Esperanza Rising.  We are busy writing poems that will be featured alongside the book.
There will be 2 cafe's on Thursday night.  One at 5:30 and one at 6:30.  Students will only perform at one of the cafe's.  Assigned times were sent home on Thursday, January 5th. Each cafe session will last about 45 minutes and includes hot drinks and snacks for the whole family.

There will be no new spelling words assigned until 3rd quarter.  This is because we are busy wrapping up this quarter's work and preparing for Celebration of Learning.  Look for new words on January 23.

We are Voyagers like ancestors of old. We are strong, inventive, courageous, and filled with wonder. 
Sailing seas of knowledge, we seek understanding and use it with compassion. 
Looking forward, we honor the past to better see our future. We will find hope and success in spite of wind and change. 
With our eyes to the heavens, fixed on guiding lights, we know ourselves, our space, our time. 
We will seek, we will find, we will know new horizons. 
We are Mighty Voyagers!
