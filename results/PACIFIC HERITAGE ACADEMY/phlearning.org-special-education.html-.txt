Child Find Notice
Every child is entitled to a public education regardless of disability. Children with disabilities may go without services because families are not fully aware of their entitlement. If you know of a child, birth to age 22, who is not receiving any education services or feel that your child is in need of additional services, speak to your child’s classroom teacher or contact the administration or Special Education Department at Pacific Heritage Academy.
The collection and use of data to meet the requirement are subject to the confidentiality of information provisions under the Utah State Board of Education Special Education Rules.
We are Voyagers like ancestors of old. We are strong, inventive, courageous, and filled with wonder. 
Sailing seas of knowledge, we seek understanding and use it with compassion. 
Looking forward, we honor the past to better see our future. We will find hope and success in spite of wind and change. 
With our eyes to the heavens, fixed on guiding lights, we know ourselves, our space, our time. 
We will seek, we will find, we will know new horizons. 
We are Mighty Voyagers!
