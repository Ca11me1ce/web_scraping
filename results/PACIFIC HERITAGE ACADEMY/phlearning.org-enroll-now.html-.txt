I understand that this application does not guarantee my child(ren) placement at this school.
I understand that all openings are filled via a random lottery, with initial preference given to faculty students and siblings of enrolled students as set forth in state law and our Charter.
I understand that due to a change in Utah State Law, if my child is offered a position and I decide to accept, I must do so in writing.

We are Voyagers like ancestors of old. We are strong, inventive, courageous, and filled with wonder. 
Sailing seas of knowledge, we seek understanding and use it with compassion. 
Looking forward, we honor the past to better see our future. We will find hope and success in spite of wind and change. 
With our eyes to the heavens, fixed on guiding lights, we know ourselves, our space, our time. 
We will seek, we will find, we will know new horizons. 
We are Mighty Voyagers!
