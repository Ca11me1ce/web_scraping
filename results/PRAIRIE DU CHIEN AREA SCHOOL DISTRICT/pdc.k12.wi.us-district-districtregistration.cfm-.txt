Thank you for choosing the Prairie du Chien Area School District for your child(ren)!  We are happy to serve you. Although it’s hard to believe, we are only a few weeks away from the start of another great school year which means the registration process is beginning. Online registration for the 2017-2018 school year is now open!  For those of you who are new to our district, online registration is required before school starts. Again this year, the district will not host a face to face district registration day; all registration will be done online. Please read the following carefully and don’t hesitate to touch base if you need assistance. 
To begin, log on to 
Skyward Family Access,
 or go to the district webpage, 
www.pdc.k12.wi.us
, under any of the school tabs and click “Skyward Login.” The registration link is in the upper left hand corner within the Skyward Access page. If you do not know your Skyward login and/or password, please use the “Forgot Your Login/Password Link” or contact the district office at (608) 326-3714.
There are three tutorial screens in the registration process that may help your registration experience go smoothly. All three are part of the free and reduced application (needs to be filled out in order to waive the $150/student registration fee). Please review these prior to completing the free and reduced application:
Step 1 - Free and Reduced Application
Federal Income Chart
Sharing Information with Other Programs
Following the information within these links will help ensure your application is completed correctly and will help to avoid the $150 registration fee.
After finishing registration, please take the time to review the “Fee Management” and “Food Service” Skyward Family Access tabs for outstanding fees and balances. Most fees and breakfast/lunch costs are the same as prior years; you can go to this webpage 
Prairie du Chien School District Fees
 to see all fee amounts.
You will again notice the step in the registration process for transportation. This is how our busing information will be tabulated for the 2017-2018 school year. If this information is not completed, we will not have the information to place your child on a bus route. We work diligently to ensure that all of our students arrive safely to and from school, so please do your part in helping us with this important task. Contact any school office with questions. An updated map of in town bus stops and locations is attached to help you choose the best option(s) for your child(ren). You have the option of indicating all bus needs for your child (in and out of town) in this section of registration. This link, 
Transportation Tutorial Link
, can be used as a guide to successfully fill out this section.
Completing the online registration is required prior to August 18, 2017 at 4:00p.m. Failure to register by this time will mean your child is not guaranteed a bus pick up or drop off upon the start of school. After the 18th, you will receive a phone call reminder if registration is incomplete or hasn’t been started. If registration is not complete by the start of school on September 1, 2017, a $150 per student fee will be assessed on or before September 6, 2017.
If you do not have access to a computer or internet, need assistance completing your materials, or have other questions about online registration, please contact Mrs. Sarah Adrian in the B.A. Kennedy Office at (608) 326-3720, Mrs. Peg Bauer in the Bluff View School Office at (608) 326-3866 or Mrs. Jan Ostrander in the High School Office at (608) 326-3721.
