Best Practices for District Communications
The Board desires that District citizens receive high quality educational services and prompt attention to issues and concerns. In order to establish an efficient and effective organizational model, a chain of command process is in place for handling matters involving the District. Questions and concerns about individual students or school-related activities should be raised with the involved teacher(s) or school principal. For  example, questions about athletics or other extra-curricular activities, the coach or advisor is the appropriate person to contact. If for some reason an issue cannot be resolved with the teacher, coach or advisor, it is appropriate to then contact an assistant principal, athletic director or principal.
District Administrator should be contacted with questions and concerns related to district operations, or if an issue could not be resolved at the school building level. Questions or concerns about the District’s administration or policies should be directed to the Superintendent of Schools. The Superintendent will address any questions or concerns with the School Board that require the Board’s determination. The School Board can also be contacted with questions or concerns if matters could not be satisfactorily addressed by the Superintendent.
Due to Wisconsin’s Open Meetings Law, School Board members must avoid policy and procedure discussions with other Board members and citizens regarding District matters outside of properly posted meetings. Individual Board members have no authority over District policies, operations or decisions. Only the School Board, at a properly noticed meeting, can discuss and take official action on matters affecting the District.  For this reason, School Board members are generally not involved in the day-to-day decisions that occur within the schools and the District.
District residents with concerns and comments about our district are also welcome to attend all School Board meetings and to address the Board at those meetings. Board meetings are normally scheduled for the second Monday of each month. at 6:30pm at the City Council Meeting Chambers at the Prairie du Chien City Hall. Citizens may speak during the public comment portion of the meeting. Board Members generally are limited in their response  to citizen comments during a public comment period as only items identified on a properly posted agenda, in accordance with Wisconsin Open Meeting Laws can be addressed at a meeting of the Board.  As  a result, the issue may be delayed to a future agenda if the board desires to have further discussion or to take action on the matter or citizens may be referred to the appropriate administrator for proper resolution.
