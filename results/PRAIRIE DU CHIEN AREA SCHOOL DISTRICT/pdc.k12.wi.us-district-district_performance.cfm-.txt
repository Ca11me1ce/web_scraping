DPI School Performance Reports
DPI provides public performance reports for all public schools and districts in Wisconsin. The reports each address sections of state or federal reporting requirements. All reports-and the many and varied indicators contained within-should be considered when reviewing a school or district?s annual progress. While some of the same data appears in multiple reports, each serves a distinct purpose under state and federal education laws.
WISEdash
Wisconsin Information System for Education Data Dashboard. Where you can compare and explore statistics about Wisconsin public schools.
The Prairie du Chien School District is are very proud of our teachers and feel they are ready to give your child a high-quality education.  All of the PdC schools are Schoolwide Title I schools, so we must meet federal rules related to teacher qualifications as defined in No Child Left Behind (NCLB).  These rules allow you to learn more about your child’s teachers’ training and credentials.  We are happy to provide this information to you.  At any time, you may ask:
Whether the teacher met state qualifications and certification requirements of the grade level and subject he/she is teaching,
Whether the teacher received an emergency or conditional certificate through which state qualifications were waived, and
What undergraduate or graduate degrees the teacher holds, including graduate certificates and additional degrees, and major(s) or area(s) of concentration.
You may also ask whether your child receives help from a paraprofessional.  If your child receives this assistance, we can provide you with information about the paraprofessional’s qualifications.
Our staff is committed to helping your child develop the academic knowledge and critical thinking he/she needs to succeed in school and beyond.  That commitment includes making sure that all of our teachers and paraprofessionals are highly skilled.
If you are interested in looking into matters on your own, you may go to the DPI License Lookup to search the Wisconsin DPI's information.
DPI Wisconsin License Lookup
The License Lookup returns real-time DPI information on Wisconsin educator licenses and license applications as of the date and time of the search. Search results may be used as proof of educator licensure and/or submission of a license application to DPI.
