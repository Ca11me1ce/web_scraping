SUMMER SCHOOL 2018
(Please contact Andy Banasik at 608-326-3702 if you have questions)
This summer session is an effort by the district to meet the needs of students going into grades seven through twelve. The student's “grade level” is based off the grade the student will be in during the 2018-2019 school year. Summer school will provide the students with the opportunity to earn credits in two areas. All classes are subject to cancellation due to student numbers. 
Courses
: 
SUMMER ACADEMY – 
for credit
7:45AM – 10:15AM      6/11 – 6/29 AND 7/9 – 7/27 
The Summer Academy will be taught in an online platform but require face-to-face attendance by students with a classroom teacher. Students will have the choice to recover credits failed during the regular school year, or take semester elective classes in the area of their interest to get ahead for the upcoming school year. The significant advantage of the Summer Academy is that students will have classroom assistance daily with the ability to choose individualized classes in the online environment. Students will be allowed a maximum of two absences for the Summer Academy session. Any additional absences will cause the student to be removed from the class with a failing grade.
All students are required to attend every day and attendance is considered mandatory. 
Students must pass the class with at least 70%
. No discipline problems will be tolerated. There are no general fees for the Summer Academy summer school courses.
Students taking the Summer Academy may have up to two total excused absences. The third absence will result in removal from the course with an F.

We take Driver Education very seriously here at Prairie du Chien High School. Our goal is to provide a thorough training program for our students, meeting or exceeding all state requirements. We aim to produce well-prepared, responsible new drivers within our community. We want your student to feel confident upon completion of our program.
*A specific number of minutes are required by DPI in order for students to earn credit and by the DOT to receive a permit. For that reason, the following will apply on attendance.
Students taking the Driver’s Education course will be allowed one excused absence. The second absence will result in removal from the course with an F.
Our program is “student driven” which means we hire our driving instructors based upon the number of registrations per session. It is to your advantage, to register as soon as you have decided which session your student will attend. We accommodate physically challenged students. There is a 
$400 (BOE Approved August 2016) nonrefundable fee due before or on the first day of classroom instruction. A 
Motorist Handbook
 will be available on the first day of class. It can also be found online at the 
Wisconsin Department of Transportation
. 
The State of Wisconsin mandates the following requirements to obtain a Course Completion Certificate:
30 Hours of Driver Education Classroom instruction
6 Hours of Behind-the-Wheel (BTW) instruction 
30 Hours of certified driving practice, 10 of which must be during darkness. 
The student must be at least 15 years old by the first day of classroom instruction. To take BTW, the student must be at least 15 ½ years old, and have obtained his/her Instructional Permit, by the first day of scheduled driving.
The Prairie du Chien High School mandates the following requirements to obtain a Course Completion Certificate:
The student must have passed ALL academic classes during the semester 1 and semester 2 grading periods during the 2017-2018 school year in order to be eligible. Academic classes include English, History, Math, and Science. 
Successful credit recovery during the June SUMMER ACADEMY may allow enrollment in the July Driver’s Education class.
Students are allowed one absence. Attendance is very important, and every effort should be made to have students attend as scheduled. Thus, parents are cautioned to plan family vacations with the state mandates in mind.
A Completion Certificate is required in order to take the road test for obtaining a probationary license. Permit tests will be given during the class. The student will receive 0.5 elective credit for the classroom instruction.
