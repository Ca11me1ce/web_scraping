          Civil Rights        
EDIT MAIN
EDIT HTML BLOCK
	Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 is a federal civil rights statute that prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability. All school districts that receive federal funding are responsible for the implementation of this law. Administered by the U.S. Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights (OCR), the Minnesota Department of Education has no enforcement authority for Section 504. A link to the OCR website is available on this page.
