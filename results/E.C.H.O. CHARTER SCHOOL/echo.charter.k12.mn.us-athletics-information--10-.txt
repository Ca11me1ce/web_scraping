ECHO Athletics Mission Statement
	The mission of the E.C.H.O Charter School Athletic Department is to provide student-athletes with an opportunity to compete in high school athletics at a level which challenges each student to be his/her best. Student-athletes will always be encouraged to push themselves to reach their highest potential physically, academically and morally. Perseverance, respect, humility, and servant leadership will be the cornerstones of all athletic programs at Echo as we strive to prepare our student-athletes to be strong leaders of their families and community both now as well as in the future.
	Beliefs
We believe the students-athletes are students first, and then athletes.
We believe the ECHO athletic programs should compliment and support the academic programs already in place at E.C.H.O. Charter School.
We believe that the most important result of competition is the development of character and life-long values and skills.
We believe that when you train and play the right way, winning will take care of itself and thus does not need to be prioritized.
