Frequently Asked Questions
What is the DeKalb County Schools Campus Portal?
The DeKalb County Schools Campus Portal is a confidential and secure website that allows parents/guardians to log in and view their child’s progress in school. The goal of the Campus Portal is to create a better partnership between parents and teachers.
How do I access the DeKalb County Schools Campus Portal?
The URL is: 
https://campus.dekalb.k12.ga.us/campus/portal/dekalb.jsp
, and the District code is FLZLHV.
If you had a User ID and Password for eSIS Parent Assistant, use the same credentials to access Campus Portal.
Does it work on mobile devices?
Yes, there is a 
mobile app
 available. Download and install the 
District’s mobile app
, then click on the Infinite Campus Parent Portal link to download the Campus Mobile app. When prompted for the District’s code, enter FLZLHV.
How secure is the information contained in the Portal?
The Campus Portal incorporates the highest level of security. Parents/guardians can see only information related to the students they are authorized to view. The use of strong passwords and session timeouts ensure secure access.
Do I need special software installed on my computer?
To effectively access your Campus Portal account, you will need:
Internet Access: A high-speed internet connection (cable or DSL) is recommended.
Adobe Reader: This is a free document reader available for download on the web at 
http://get.adobe.com/reader
Who can access the Campus Portal?
Parents and guardians designated with legal rights to student records may receive a Campus Portal account.
Each parent/guardian, with such rights, will receive their own separate account. Accounts are NOT shared. All students are automatically issued their own Campus Portal account within 24 hours of enrolling into the DeKalb County School District. Students should check with their school for additional information.
What if I had a Parent Assistant portal account on our previous system?
Use the same User ID and Password. If you have forgotten your Password, 
 view the Account Management video
 to learn how to reset your password. If you have forgotten your User ID, go to 
 Infinite Campus Portal
 and click on DCSD Portal Account Activation. You will be prompted to enter your child’s 7-digit DCSD student number, your child’s 9-digit social security number, and your child’s date of birth. When this information has been entered, click the Submit button. The panel will return your User ID if one was found.
How do I create a user account so I can use the Campus Portal?
You will need to retrieve an activation code before you can create a username and password. You may visit 
 Infinite Campus Portal
 and click on DCSD Portal Account Activation. You will be prompted to enter your child’s 7-digit DCSD student number, your child’s 9-digit social security number, and your child’s date of birth. When this information has been entered, click the Submit button. If you are successful in retrieving your activation code, click the Activate Your Parent Portal Account Now to create your username and password. Note: Please do not use a numeric only username as it may conflict with a student account.
If you are unsuccessful in retrieving your activation code on the first try and you have more than one child in the district, please attempt to retrieve your activation code by entering the requested information for all children in the household. If you are still unsuccessful, please contact your child’s school and be prepared to visit the school with a picture ID to receive your activation code.
What if I do not see all of my children when I log into the Campus Portal?
