About Us
The Academy for Math, Engineering & Science (AMES), located at Cottonwood High School in Salt Lake City, provides high school students (grades 9-12) opportunities to extend their knowledge beyond the typical high school curriculum, especially into the worlds of technology, math, science and engineering. At AMES, we are looking for students who are: 
SEARCHING for better educational opportunities
WILLING to work hard
APPLYING themselves to challenges
EAGER to try new things
It is NOT about attracting students with the highest GPAs or best SAT scores. AMES is a public school with open enrollment to all students. 
AMES is a stimulating and inspiring place for bright, talented, and disciplined students. We offer an exceptional teaching staff, including University of Utah faculty and Salt Lake-area professionals, and small classes where individual needs can be met. In fact, no more than 500 students will be enrolled in AMES. Courses include integrated programs in math, science, technology, computer science and engineering as well as core classes in language arts, social studies, and the arts. Additional courses offered through Cottonwood High School round out the total AMES experience.
