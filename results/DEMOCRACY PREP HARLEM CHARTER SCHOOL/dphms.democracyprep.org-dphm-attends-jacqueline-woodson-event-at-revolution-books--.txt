DPHM Attends Jacqueline Woodson Event at Revolution Books
Posted on Thursday / January 18
DPHM was one of three very lucky schools that were invited to attend a Jacqueline Woodson event at local Harlem bookstore, Revolution Books.  15 scholars were selected to read Brown Girl Dreaming for book club and had the opportunity to see the National Book Award winning author read from her books, answer their questions and sign their books – a DREAM come true!  
It was a wonderful event!  Our scholars asked thoughtful questions and were deeply engaged with the text.  The event was even more special because DPHM scholars were the first students that Jacqueline Woodson met with since being named the National Ambassador for Young People’s Literature.  Below is a link to Ms. Woodson’s twitter feed and some pictures of our scholars with her.
