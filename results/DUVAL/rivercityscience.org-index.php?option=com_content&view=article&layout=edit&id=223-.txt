		More than $500 Raised for Healing Hearts Project
RCSA Mandarin celebrated Valentine's Day by giving back this year.
The Community Service Club hosted a dress down day which raised $537.35 for the Healing Hearts Project.
The Healing Hearts Project is a local nonprofit run by parents and caregivers dedicated to helping families affected by congenital heart disease.
Congenital heart disease, a heart defect, affects 1 in 100 babies born. Healing Hearts makes it their mission to support families during and after diagnosis with a support system, donated meals, and the Heart Cart.
The Heart Cart travels around Nemours Hospital, offering comfort to the patients and families on the cardiac floor. Mandarin students also collected supplies for this cart including snacks, coffee and toiletries. 
Thank you to all the RCSA students and families who participated in this wonderful project!
