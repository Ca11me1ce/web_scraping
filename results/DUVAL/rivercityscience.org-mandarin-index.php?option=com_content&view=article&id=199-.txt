		RCSA Mandarin Celebrates Grand Opening
RCSA Mandarin officially celebrated the opening of its new building Monday with a ribbon cutting ceremony.
Dozens of community members and leaders joined RCSA staff and students for the grand opening, hosted with the Jax Chamber. State Senator Aaron Bean, City Council President Anna Brosche and School Board Member Lori Hershey gave opening remarks at the ribbon cutting.
Senator Bean addressed the safety patrol students present, speaking to them of the exciting opportunities that await them in future careers. Brosche and Hershey both celebrated the success of the Mandarin campus in its first year, achieving an A grade in the 2016-2017 school year.
Following the ceremony, guests toured the new school building, which is home to grades 3-7. Led by safety patrols, the guests were able to visit classrooms and the book fair and watch several student-led STEM demonstrations.
Students were delighted by some of the school's more unusual guests- members of Squad 7 of the 501st Legion. Five volunteers came dressed as Star Wars characters, thrilling students and teachers alike and demonstrating RCSA's love of learning about galaxies far, far away.
Elected officials, Jax Chamber members, guests, staff and students then enjoyed a lunch, allowing RCSA to continue forming valued bonds with the community. The grand opening event spotlighted the incredible work being done at RCSA Mandarin every day.
