		RCSA Athletics
At RCSA, students and staff are committed to living a healthy, balanced lifestyle where both strong minds and strong bodies are built. Physical education is integrated into the curriculum so students develop healthy habits to continue for the rest of their lives.
By participating in organized sports, students grow personally as leaders and become well-rounded. RCSA athletes learn important lessons in teamwork, self-discipline and leadership on and off the field. RCSA athletics builds a sense of comradery among athletes and spirit among all students and staff.
The RCSA Rockets battle other area schools in several sports. Students can play volleyball (Middle School, Junior Varsity, Varsity), basketball (Middle School, Junior Varsity, Varsity) and cheerleading. The RCSA Middle School is a member of the North Florida Sports Association and the high school competes in the Florida High School Athletic Association. Students and parents love to support the Rockets at games and pep rallies.
Several athletic clubs also meet weekly including yoga, table tennis and Zumba. The running club meets weekly for boys and girls. Students run with teachers in different pace groups in progressive two and three mile loops. The group participates in local 5K races to celebrate their growth.
2017 was a great year for the Rockets!
The high school girls basketball team took home second place in its division after a hard fought season and championship game. The middle school girls team captured 3rd
 place in the NFSA.
