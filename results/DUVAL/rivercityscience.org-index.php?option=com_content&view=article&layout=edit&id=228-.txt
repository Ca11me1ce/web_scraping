		Students Organize Walkout Honoring Parkland Victims
Student organizers led hundreds of high school students in a walkout Wednesday in solidarity with the victims of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.
Students filed out of the school silently, carrying signs reading “Arm us with Books, Not Bullets”, “Protect Our Youth” and “Never Again”. They stood in 17 rows to honor the 17 victims of the Parkland shooting.
Each minute, a student read the name and a short biography of a life lost in the tragedy.
This optional event was organized by a small group of students who felt compelled to honor the lives lost so close to home, and to further a conversation on school safety.
Following the 17-minute walkout, students participated in a campaign of kindness, filling the school walls with kind notes for classmates and teachers.
During this time, middle school students participated in a lesson on exercising First Amendment rights. However, this didn’t satisfy all the students.
At lunch, 8th graders stood in silence, with one student reading the names of each of the victims. They held a sign reading “Be Kind, No Gun Violence”. The 8th graders, who organized this gesture without any support, stood in silence for five minutes before continuing with their day of kindness.
March 14th proved to be a powerful day for students and staff. RCSA is proud to offer a safe space for students to express themselves and their opinions.
