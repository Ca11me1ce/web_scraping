		College Mentorship Program
 CMP Introduction
The College Mentorship Program (CMP) is a voluntary mentoring program designed to prepare selected students for the best colleges and universities. Students will gain knowledge and experience in social networking, academics, extracurricular activities and character education. 
We strongly believe that the students within a collaborative and cooperative environment can achieve and go above and beyond their educational goals. CMP is a commitment to a long term interactive relationship between a mentor and mentee which will enhance the student’s probability of acceptance into top ranking colleges and universities. Each student in this program will be assigned a mentor. Mentors work with three or four students. The students and mentor will meet weekly to complete assignments and monitor progress. Mentors and mentees also participate in leadership seminars, community service programs, college visits and more.
CMP Mission and Vision

The mission of the CMP is to provide academic and social opportunities for high achieving students to develop the leadership and teamwork skills necessary for college and career.
