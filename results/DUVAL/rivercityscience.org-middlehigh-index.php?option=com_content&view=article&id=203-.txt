		High School Honors Black History Month
An assembly honored and celebrated African American history and culture as well as raised important discussions on multiculturalism and diversity.
The afternoon kicked off with a performance of Lift Every Voice and Sing. Next came a conversation on soul food and a demonstration of how to make corn bread.
Students participated in a trivia competition and in an interactive panel discussion on the importance of multiculturalism and embracing a diverse environment.
There were performances by students in dance, theater, poetry and step. Overall, the assembly served as a reminder for high school students to come together, learn and celebrate one another.
