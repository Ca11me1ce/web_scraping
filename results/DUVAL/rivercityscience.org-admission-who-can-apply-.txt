		Who is eligible to attend charter schools?
Charter schools are open to all students residing within the district. As schools of choice, all RCSA schools are open to any student who wishes to apply, regardless of where he or she lives within Duval county.
By law, charter schools cannot use an admissions process that discriminates against students. Charter schools accept all students who wish to attend, space permitting. If there are more students who wish to attend than there are seats available, a lottery process is used to randomly select students.
