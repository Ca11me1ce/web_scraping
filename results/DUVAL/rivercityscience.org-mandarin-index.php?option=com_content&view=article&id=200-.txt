		RCSA Mandarin Celebrates Literacy with Week of Reading Fun
This week is Florida’s Celebrate Literacy Week, and RCSA Mandarin is celebrating in style.
All students have engaged in reading activities each day.
On Monday, students began writing their own books. On Tuesday, a mystery staff member surprised students as a guest reader.
On Wednesday, students in the upper grades partnered with younger students as buddy readers, showing off their reading and leadership skills.
On Thursday, classes will take turns writing a traveling story and students will get to dress down Friday.
These students are having a great time celebrating the magic of stories and reading. Thanks to teachers and staff for setting up these fun events!
