		RCSA Celebrates the Literary Arts in First Annual Fair
Hundreds of students and parents joined the first annual Literary Fair Saturday, making the event a huge success.
Students had their choice of workshops and presentations, and participated in at least four workshops. Students explored new forms of literary art including calligraphy and black out poetry, where a poem is created from words already existing on a page.
Students also heard from literary experts in journalism, from Barnes and Noble and the Jacksonville Public Library. Two authors also joined students via Skype, offering guidance in writing and publishing original work.
While not in a workshop, students and families enjoyed performances from the drama club and from RCSA alumnus William Bell’s dance group.
The afternoon wrapped up with a celebration of the winners of the Literary Fair. Winners were selected for each grade level in poetry and prose.
Students were celebrated in an awards ceremony following keynote remarks from guest speaker Catalina Alers-Alers of 97.9 KISS FM.
“My favorite part of the day was two-fold. The first was honoring our students’ hard work in the awards ceremony,” said Fair Coordinator Amanda Ferrari. “The second, and equally as fulfilling, was peeking into the creative writing workshops and performances to see how much our students were enjoying them.”
The Literary Fair will only continue to grow.
“Next year I plan to offer more workshops, invite more poets and authors and create a bound portfolio of all of the students’ submissions to commemorate the event,” Ferrari said.
