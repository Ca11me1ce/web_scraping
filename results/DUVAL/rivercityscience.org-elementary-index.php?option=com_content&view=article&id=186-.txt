		Florida’s First Lady Ann Scott Visits RCSA Elementary
Tuesday, September 27, 2016 proved to be an extraordinary day at RCSA Elementary. Florida’s First Lady Ann Scott visited our campus, with two visits to classrooms, where she read to the students, educated them about the Governor’s Mansion, and shared stories of her family and life as the First Lady of Florida. It was a pleasure to have her, and we can’t wait for her and Governor Scott to visit again.
