		History Dress-Up Day & Mrs. Curry’s visit to kick off our Book Marathon
Wednesday, January 25th was an extraordinary day at River City Science Academy Elementary.  As part of its Literacy through History initiative, RCSA Elementary has invited Jacksonville’s First Lady, Mrs. Molly Curry, to read to their students about important leaders in history that made paramount advances in science.  We used also Mrs. Curry’s visit to kick off our Book Marathon challenging the students of RCSAES to enough pages to extend 26.5 miles.
First Lady Curry will start by reading The Tree Lady, by Joseph Hopkins, to RCSA’s primary students about Kate Session, an American botanist, horticulturalist, and landscape architect, who is known as the “Mother of Balboa Park” because of her work in San Diego, California. 
First Lady Curry read to RCSA’s intermediate students Maria Curie: Prize-Winning Scientist, by Lori Mortensen, which is about the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize for Physics.  
RCSA believes that this reading initiative is significant, as it is a means to motivate students to read about noteworthy people and events in history that have made impacts on us today.  They were incredibly grateful to have the First Lady of Jacksonville help them spread this message.
