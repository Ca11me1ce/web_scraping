		Admission Process
River City Science Academy schools admit any student eligible to attend Duval County Public Schools who submits a timely application. RCSA admits students of any race, color, national origin, religion or gender. The schools have an open enrollment window. Applications will be accepted each year during the open enrollment window and continuously to maintain capacity in each grade level. The deadline for applications, lottery date and registrations are announced on each school website and at the front offices.
If the schools receive more applications than there are available spots for any grade level a lottery will be held to determine admittance. All applicants who applied by the deadline will have equal opportunity in the drawing. When capacity is reached, a waiting list will be formed with the lottery process. If the number of applicants is less than the number of available seats in a grade level there will not be a lottery.
As provided for in Florida’s Charter School Legislation, the school will give enrollment priority to the following students if a spot is available:
 • Students who are the sibling of a student already enrolled in the school
 • Students who are the children of an employee or founding governing board member of the charter school.
Students in these categories will be admitted automatically. If the number of applicants in the above priority groups exceeds the number of vacancies a lottery will be held.
Applications submitted for the prior school year will not roll over or be valid to be processed in the following school year. A new application must be submitted during the open enrollment window to be considered
All applications received after the open enrollment window has closed will be added to the bottom of the waiting list for that program, class or grade level in the order they were received.
Families will be notified in writing of their child’s acceptance no later than three weeks past the acceptance period deadline and will have a set amount of time to respond in writing. If an accepted applicant decides not to attend the school or does not inform the school of the decision on time the space will be given to a student on the waiting list.
Out of county students may apply to RCSA schools following the same timeline. If the school has an opening after giving priority to Duval County applicants and calling students on the waiting list, remaining spots will be available to out of Duval County applicants in the order of application for each grade level
Transportation is the responsibility of the parent for out of county students. If an out of county student has excessive tardiness or absences the school will notify the parent and the student will be dismissed from RCSA to the student’s zone school.
