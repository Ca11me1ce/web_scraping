		2nd Grade Hosts African American Wax Museum
	History came alive Feb. 23 at RCSA Innovation as 2nd graders put together an amazing African American Wax Museum.
	The wax museum depicted the many modern day and historical accomplishments of African Americans.
	Each student dressed up to represent an individual from past or present including Frederick Douglass, Barack Obama, Louis Armstrong and Oprah Winfrey. The students researched their figure and created a presentation to share with visitors.
	All grade levels and parents were invited to attend the wax museum and learn more about these important figures in American history.
