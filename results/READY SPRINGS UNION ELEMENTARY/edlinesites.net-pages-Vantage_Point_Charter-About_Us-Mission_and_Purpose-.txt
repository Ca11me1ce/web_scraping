Mission and Purpose
Mission and Purpose
Our Mission
Vantage Point Charter School’s mission is to help our students attain academic, cultural, social and emotional literacy. We offer each student a personalized individualized learning opportunity facilitated and supported by Vantage Point staff and parents. The students’ sense of ownership elicits enthusiasm, interest and involvement.  
Our Purpose
The purpose of Vantage Point Charter is to provide individualized learning programs through a program of independent study. Families choose independent study for a variety of reasons.
to avoid unacceptable social exposures
to allow for unique needs best met through individualized learning
to work around family needs that interfere with attendance at a “seat time” classroom
to allow students to hold a job
to allow for acceleration or remediation
to continue the education process during times of emotional or physical impairment
