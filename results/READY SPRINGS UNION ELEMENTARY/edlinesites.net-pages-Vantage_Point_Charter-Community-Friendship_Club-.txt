Friendship Club
Friendship Club
Founded in 1995, The Friendship Club is a prevention program designed to reach at-risk girls before they engage in unhealthy behaviors. We teach the girls life skills, personal responsibility and the value of hard work through a year-around program of educational activities, emotional support and community involvement.
