Welcome
Welcome
Welcome to the Penn Valley Union Elementary School District!
The staff and I are looking forward to a wonderful and exciting year of seeing our students engage, learn and grow both academically and socially. We plan to continue to build upon excellent traditions, as well as look ahead at new ideas that will encourage collaboration and bridge common practices for student success.  We want all students, staff and parents to experience excellence as we promote an environment that is positive, engaging, and academically rigorous in order to keep up with a 21st Century world. Learning together is what makes our educational environment thrive and grow.
We strive to maintain an open door policy at all times as it is critical to hear from all stakeholders.  Educating our youth cannot be accomplished alone.  We need to hear all voices in order to maintain healthy schools where children learn academic and social skills. It is through the support of the community that programs thrive and students obtain hands-on experiences. Throughout this school year, I encourage and challenge you totake the time from your busy day and volunteer on a campus near you to learn about the amazing things happening within our schools.
We look forward to a wonderful school year in 2016-17.  Knowing we face challenges in education will always be on the horizon as budgets are tight and programs are a must for our students.  We assure you that students in our district will receive the best curriculum and programs possible as we have so much to offer on all levels including music and the arts.  
Dr. Torie England
