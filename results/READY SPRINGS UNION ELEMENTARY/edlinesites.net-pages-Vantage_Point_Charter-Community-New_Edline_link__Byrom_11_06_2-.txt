About Us
NEO, which stands for New Events & Opportunities, is an innovative grassroots nonprofit youth center and youth empowerment program. NEO was founded by two nineteen-year olds in 2008 and hosted over 350 teen led events throughout western Nevada County before opening our Youth Center in 2015.
We serve youth and young adults between the ages on 11-25 years old.
