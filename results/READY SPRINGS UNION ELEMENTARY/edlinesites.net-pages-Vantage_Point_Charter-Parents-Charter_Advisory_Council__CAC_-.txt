Charter Advisory Council (CAC)
Vantage Point is inviting students and their families to join our Charter Advisory Council (CAC).  Become involved in your and your child’s education and have a voice in the direction of our school.   Fundraising, activities and fun events are also discussed!
Our monthly CAC meetings (Charter Advisory Council) take place the 4th Monday of each month from 4:00 to 5:00 pm. These are fun meetings that include teachers, parents and students. The group gives ideas for the direction of Vantage Point - and also decides things like: senior trips, prom themes, and field trips. Please join us!
