IMPORTANT INFORMATION!!!
Summer is almost here and we are gearing up for everything that will be happening.  
SUMMERTIME UNLIMITED GYMNASTICS IS BACK!!!
Summer is a great time for our athletes to really push themselves to the next level.  This summer we are offering unlimited clinics when enrolled for one regular class.  Each day, Monday through Thursday, we will be offering a clinic specializing on a skill or an event.  Gymnasts enrolled in one class can attend as many clinics each week as they desire - FOR FREE!  These clinics will start mid June and will be offered until mid August.
And don't forget to take advantage of your 2 weeks of vacation a year so you don't have to drop and lose your spot in class.  We offer every family a two-week vacation without the need to un-enroll.  Simply pay for the additional two weeks of the month (or split them up) and keep your child enrolled.
SUMMER SHOWCASE IS ALMOST HERE!
Mark your calendar and sign your child up before June 1st.  Every year we take the time to honor our gymnasts for the hard work they put in.  During the week of June 18th - 21st, we will suspend regular classes and will host an exhibition event where your child will perform a routine they will learn the previous few weeks that encompasses what they have learned throughout the year.  Each gymnast will receive a medal for completing the showcase!  Gymnasts must be enrolled in classes and registered in adcance for the showcase.  There is a $10 fee to participate which included 2 spectator tickets to the event.  Additional spectator tickets will go on sale June 4th for $5 per ticket until sold out.
SUMMER CAMP!!!
Summer camp information is up and registration has begun, as well.  We will be having 4 separate weeks, each with different themes and all will be fun!  Download the registration form and send it in to reserve your child's spot.  They do fill up so don't miss out.
Be sure to check out our Calendar page and Newsletter for more upcoming events!
