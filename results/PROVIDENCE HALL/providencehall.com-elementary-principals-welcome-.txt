Principal's Welcome
	Greetings and Welcome to Providence Hall Elementary School, Home of the Patriots!
	Providence Hall Elementary is an authorized International Baccalaureate (IB) Primary Years Programme (PYP) School. As an IB school, we prepare students for intellectual challenges, focusing on the development of the whole child as an inquirer, both within the classroom and the outside world. Our dedicated professional staff embraces the nurturing of our students academically, socially and emotionally, while developing learning skills, strong personal values and global mindedness.
	Partnering with parents/families is so important in these formative years of early education. Families are encouraged to be active participants in their children's education. Partnering with our school opens opportunities for home/school communication, direct assistance in classrooms, and support/participation in special events and programs throughout the school year. Everyone here at Providence Hall looks forward to establishing strong, productive and successful relationships that benefit our students.
	As the new principal at Providence Hall Elementary, I am honored to work with such an excellent staff and charter school system. I look forward to meeting and working with each family and getting to know the children who grace our halls. I promise you I will be working hard for students and teachers to make this school a quality experience. It is going to be a truly exciting year!
	I encourage parents to keep email and phone numbers updated throughout the year so strong communication can occur. Should you need my assistance, you may contact me by email at 
ehuff@providencehall.com
, call the school at 801-727-8260, or come by to schedule an appointment.
	Yours Truly,
	Earleen Huff
	Principal
