Principal's Welcome
Dear Providence Hall Community,
Providence Hall is an exceptional and respectable school whose IB curriculum cultivates student's cognitive abilities through teaching them to critically think, inquire, and analyze. Through the implementation of the IB curriculum, students are able to gain the college and career-ready attributes necessary for post-secondary educational success. They become contributors to the global community and learn how to learn. They also learn the importance of service and being a part of the community. Our staff are committed to instilling these valued qualities into our educational community. As only one of 12 fully accredited K-12 IB schools in the nation and one of 9 IB Diploma Program schools in the State of Utah, we truly do require our students to aspire higher and rise above the ordinary.
It is Providence Hall's commitment to the IB curriculum, academic rigor, and development of critical thinking and reasoning skills that make it an exceptional educational institution. I am very excited to be a part of this journey here at Providence Hall and look forward to working with the students, parents, faculty, and staff this year on continuing to implement the IB Middle School Years (MYP) program at the High school as well as be a part of the implementation of the Diploma Program.
The IB program is challenging and expects a lot from our community as a whole but as we work together we will see each student develop the academic and behavioral growth they need in order to be successful in today's global community. Their development will come as teachers and parents help them to engage in the IB curriculum.
Through a close and collegial partnership with everyone associated with Providence Hall, I am confident that we can continue to make Providence Hall an exceptional educational institution.  Providence Hall truly is leading the way in developing students who will be the leaders in the local and global communities. Go Patriots!
High Regards,
Nathan Marshall
Director Providence Hall High School
