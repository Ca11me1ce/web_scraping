Junior High Expansion Donor Opportunity 
Providence Hall Junior High is expanding! Starting next year, we will no longer have any portable classrooms on our campus. We will be adding 9 beautiful new classrooms to our building to replace the portables, accommodate our increase in faculty, and maintain our small class sizes. We're doing something amazing for our kids and we want our community to be a part of it.
 We are inviting everyone to take part in this exciting project by becoming a community or corporate donor. All contributions go directly to the purchase of classroom equipment or actual room construction. Talk to your neighbors, friends, and employers as well to see if they want to become part of the Providence Hall family.
 Every contribution makes a difference. Additionally, every designated contribution level gives back directly to the donor. Rewards range from an individualized paving brick outside our building to banners or permanent plaques in each classroom with donor names. Please see the attached flyer for an explanation of the donor categories and the rewards at each level.
 Becoming a permanent part of Providence Hall is as easy as coming in to our front office and saying you want to become a donor; our office staff will help you do the rest. Please call us if you have any questions about how to participate. 
GO PATRIOTS!
