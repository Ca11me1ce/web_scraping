DANIEL ALAMO CHAVEZ - 11th Grade
Southwest Preparatory School has helped Daniel to work hard to get prepared for college. "The school makes me feel like we are part of a family.  I feel it’s a safe environment where teachers care a lot about me."   
Daniel has steadily gained confidence since day one. He has  become more confident in speaking out to groups and participating in class discussions. "When you know everyone you become comfortable in your surroundings. My teachers give me the courage to do good deeds without being shy." 
He credits his teachers giving him the confidence to reach for the stars. Daniel plans to attend a University and strives to be a mechanical Robotic Engineer. He states that "It has been a dream of mine since I was little. I know it will take a lot of work but I feel I have been prepared to succeed."
