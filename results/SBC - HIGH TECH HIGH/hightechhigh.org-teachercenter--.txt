Our program offers public school TK-12 teachers throughout San Diego County the opportunity to earn their Preliminary or Clear California teaching credential. Accredited to prepare California K-12 teachers, our programs are designed to support new teachers in developing the following tenets:
Personalization | Redefining how teachers approach designing student-centered learning experiences that meet individual needs.
Equitable Learning |  Redefining how teachers create a socially equitable, and positive, learning environment for all students.
Deeper Learning |  Redefining how teachers design authentic learning experiences with an intentional approach towards depth of knowledge.
Inclusion |  Redefining how teachers can support all students within the general education classroom
