What Makes KIPP Reach Different?
Founded in 2002 by Tracy McDaniel, KIPP Reach has flourished into one of the top middle schools in Oklahoma.
Nearly 70% of 8th graders perform in the top quartile on NWEA MAP, a national measure of academic progress – meaning they are on track for college in both reading and math as they enter high school. These scores place KIPP Reach among the highest performing KIPP schools in the country.
High Expectations
We create a culture of support and achievement and personalize learning based on a student’s needs, skills, and interests. We offer an extended school day to utilize end of day small group instruction to reach students with the highest needs.
Focus on Character
We believe that our students need both a strong academic foundation and well-developed character strengths to succeed in high school college and the world beyond.
Highly Effective Teachers & Leaders
We empower our educators to lead and invest in training to help them grow as professionals.
Safe, Structured, & Nurturing Environments
Our school provides a safe, structured, and nurturing environment so that our students thrive and maximize their learning.
KIPP Through College
We support students as they prepare for high school, college and career, and navigate social, academic, and financial challenges after they leave our school.

"When my daughter entered KIPP Reach in 5th grade, her teachers laid out a detailed plan to make sure she caught up with her peers in reading and math. It wasn't easy, but her teachers never gave up. She's in the 7th grade now and has not only improved academically... KIPP Reach has empowered her with the confidence to tackle challenging material and persevere."
