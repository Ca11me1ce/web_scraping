PCSD releases Measures of Success for Elementary Schools, Middle School and High School
Curriculum and Instruction Update
Approximately six years ago, in an attempt to allow more instructional time for literacy and improve student outcomes in reading and writing, the District made the decision to remove science and social studies from the elementary daily instructional schedule. The intent was to infuse science and social studies content into the block of time allotted for literacy instruction.
However, during this time, teachers found it increasingly difficult to adequately and consistently teach such content to students in this manner. After extensive review and discussion, an ad-hoc K-5 Study Committee, composed of teacher representatives from each grade level, recommended that Science and Social Studies be added to the daily schedule, for students in grades kindergarten through 5th grade.
To support effective implementation of both programs, teachers received training in new curriculum resources to support both subject areas. Teachers are ecstatic about this change. As Carissa Apfelbeck, a 1st grade teacher at Woodridge, expressed, "The K-5 Elementary teachers are very excited to be re-introducing Science and Social Studies instruction back into our daily routine. The hands-on engagement that is a part of both programs is exactly what our young learners want and need during the school day. These two new programs are not being implemented just to have the students solve problems and answer the questions that are presented, but also, to give students the tools they need to continue answering questions as they grow up. I believe the Science and Social Studies programs will be a fun and positive change to the great things we are already teaching our children each day."
