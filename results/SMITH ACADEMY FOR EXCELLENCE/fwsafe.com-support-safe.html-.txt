Smith Academy for Excellence		
Support SAFE
Home
Smith Academy continually strives to offer scholars the highest quality academic and extracurricular programs and experiences possible. Some of these programs include clubs, sports, field trips and internships. For these programs to be as enriching as possible, support from the community is vital. Please consider how you or your organization might be able to assist Smith Academy as we train our young men to be strong leaders!
Donate
As the academy works to provide scholars with an exemplary education as well as enriching life experiences, supplemental funding is necessary. Private and corporate donors have played a critical role in helping SAFE promote the success of our young men as they grow to be leaders in their community. The SAFE family greatly appreciates any donation offered to the school!
Smith Academy for Excellence Inc. is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. All donations to the school are tax deductible.

Memorial Funds
Cathy Guntle Memorial Fund
Cathy Guntle was the proud mother of two Smith Academy Alumni, Noah (2016) and Jacob (2017). After discovering she had cancer, Cathy decided to stop homeschooling her children and find someplace where they could continue to get a good education as well as learn godly principles. Noah and Jacob were enrolled in Smith Academy during its first year in existence.
Cathy passed away in June of 2014, after a courageous two and a half year battle with breast cancer.  To honor her legacy of service, generosity and love, her family has established the Cathy Guntle Memorial Fund.
​This fund is purposed to provide Christmas gifts and other needs for SAFE students and their families during the holiday season.
If you would like to donate to this fund, please scroll to the bottom of this page and be sure to note "Guntle Memorial Fund" when you make your donation.
Cathy Guntle Scholarship Fund

To honor the memory of their loving mother and her desire to invest in godly principles and education, Noah and Jacob have established the Cathy Guntle Scholarship Fund. 
This fund is purposed to provide money towards higher education to the top ranking student who exhibits leadership, hard work and character.

Rev. D. Ronald Rutledge was founding pastor of Fort Wayne Christian Center where he served for 25 years. He spent much time and energy trying to "turn the tide" of negative trends among Fort Wayne's youth by blending the message of Jesus Christ with the need for a quality education. So, it was with great satisfaction and praise to God that he embraced the vision of Smith Academy for Excellence. Unfortunately, due to his untimely death on February 14, 2012, Rev. Rutledge was unable to see the opening of the school, yet this educational entity burned passionately in his heart.
The Rev. D. Ronald Rutledge Memorial Fund has been set in place by his daughter, Ronnye Christina, to honor his memory by providing academic support to the brilliant young men at the academy.
