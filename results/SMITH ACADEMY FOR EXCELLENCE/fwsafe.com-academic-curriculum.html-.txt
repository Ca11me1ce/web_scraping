Literacy
Scholars will apply literal and figurative meanings and implications of words in context. 
 They will analyze, synthesize and summarize multiple informational documents in 
 light of the audience and purpose to demonstrate comprehension. Scholars will 
 also compare and contrast aspects of various genres and describe the 
 contributions of major literary movements.
When writing informational pieces, scholars will use a variety of strategies to 
 develop topics for different purposes to different audiences including quality 
 research, synthesis of information and well supported conclusions. For literary 
 texts, scholars will use a variety of planning strategies and write well 
 organized pieces with well developed settings, plots, and characters using 
 quality literary devices. Scholars will use effective structures, varied word 
 choice and proper spelling, punctuation and grammar.
Scholars will analyze the language, organization, evidence, and delivery or oral 
 communications. They will also develop and deliver well organized presentations 
 incorporating visual aids, technology and effective nonverbal elements. Scholars 
 will clarify a speaker or writer’s purpose and audience and choose appropriate 
 format for communication. They will also ask relevant questions of 
 speakers.
Four areas of literacy will be seamlessly integrated into the curriculum of the 
 academy. All scholars, regardless of grade level or subject area, will be taught 
 these literacy skills:
Reading – Subjects: history, math, English, elective, science

- To understand a concept and construct meaning
- To expand one’s experience
Writing - Subjects: history, math, English, elective, science
- To take notes
- To explain one’s thinking
- To argue a thesis and support one’s thinking
- To compare and contrast
- To write an open response
- To describe an experiment, report one’s findings, and report one’s conclusion
- To generate a response to what one has read, viewed, or heard
- To convey one’s thinking in complete sentences
- To develop an expository essay with a formal structure
Speaking – Subjects: history, math, English, elective, science
- To convey one’s thinking in complete sentences
- To interpret a passage orally

Logic and Rhetoric (Speech)
Scholars are to connect and interpret basic facts when using formal logic. The principles 
 of quality and effective speech and writing are the basis of formal rhetoric. 
 This incorporates the ability to persuade effectively through the use of sound logical 
reasoning. Learning rhetoric helps scholars grapple with ethics, and underlying 
causes for actions and the words one uses.
Science
In science, scholars will use physics, chemistry, and biology laws to categorize 
 and interpret the physical world. They will demonstrate skills using tables, 
 data, and formulas. They will also do experiments and perform dissections. They 
 will demonstrate the ability to draw logical conclusions based on 
 observations.
Humanities (Social Studies)
In Humanities, scholars will read through the works of history and literature from 
 the ancient world, the medieval world, the American world, and the modern world 
 as it pertains to their individual grade. Historical periods will be ordered 
 chronologically. Scholars will read nonfiction, biographies, historical fiction, 
 and timely pieces from today’s news. They will read, write, and speak about each 
 period of time as it relates to their particular grade. Information disseminated 
 in this curriculum will provide scholars with schema from which to draw for the 
 rest of their lives. Scholars will also study foreign languages.
Math
In Math, scholars will understand ordered relationships as represented by numbers 
 and mathematical relationships. As they progress, higher level math skills will 
 be developed and mastered. Number sense, computation, geometry, measurement, 
 algebra and functions will be developed as they relate to the grade level. 
 Analysis and prediction will be a major part of each grade’s work.
