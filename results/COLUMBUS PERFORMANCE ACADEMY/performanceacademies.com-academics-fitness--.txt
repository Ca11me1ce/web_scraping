About Us
Performance Academies has designed a proven educational program based on the following characteristics:
Quality Teachers
Each Academy hires only state-licensed instructors and employs ongoing training and mentorship programs for all its staff.
Safety and discipline are vital to the school. This includes the use of uniforms and clear rules of conduct. Throughout all the Academy’s programs, and functions, building character is key to our mission.
Safety, Discipline, and Character
Imagine It
Several studies support the use of this phonics-based program for reading and language acquisition. Its integration of new concepts and repeated practice have been shown to be effective with our students.
Saxon Math is based on two premises: first, that intellectual skills can be broken into simpler and simpler skills, and second, that practice over time builds mastery. Empirical research also shows that Saxon can significantly increase math achievement.
Saxon Math
Small Class/School Size
Each academy strives to maintain small class sizes and a low student to teacher ratio. Small classes allow for personalized attention and enhances a staff’s familiarity of students’ educational and family needs.
Students at each Academy receive at least two hours of reading each day and 90 minutes of Math. Additionally, each Academy employs an extended school day. Daily homework reinforcing the day’s lessons is also required.
Time on Task
Ongoing Assessment
In addition to all required state achievement, diagnostic, and proficiency tests, each Academy administers a fall and spring pre- and post- test, as well as curriculum-based measures in the classroom.
Using the Ohio Model Curriculum, each Academy provides 1.4 hours of fitness every day. The fitness program builds character, teamwork skills, self-esteem, and physical health.
Daily Fitness
Child Find
“Child Find” refers to the efforts put forth by each Academy to identify, locate, and evaluate children suspected of having disabilities and determine the child’s need for special education and related services. Each Academy provides ongoing screening services to ensure all students receive a free, appropriate public education.
