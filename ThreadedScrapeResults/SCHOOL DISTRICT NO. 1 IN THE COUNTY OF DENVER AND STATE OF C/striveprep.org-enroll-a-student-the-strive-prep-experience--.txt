The STRIVE Prep Experience
“Education is the most important work in the world, and specifically the type of education that STRIVE Prep is providing to scholars and families - a safe, college-bound education - is the most important work we can do as leaders in education.”

Katie Ryan, Principal STRIVE Prep - Kepner
