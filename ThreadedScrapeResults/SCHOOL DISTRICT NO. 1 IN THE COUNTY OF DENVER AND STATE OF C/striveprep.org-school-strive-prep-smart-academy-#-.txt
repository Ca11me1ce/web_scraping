Greetings!
Happy New Year! We are halfway through the year and it is a great time to re-engage in your scholar’s learning path.
Semester one report cards have been sent out. Please note: we no longer have year long grades. The grades you see are final and will appear on your scholar’s transcript. Please look over your scholar’s report card. Any course that has an A, B, or C next to it results in your scholar getting credit toward the 240 credits needed to graduate high school. If you see an F next to any course, your scholar is off track towards graduation and will have to repeat some or all of the course in order to progress forward.
Our attendance has hovered around 92% for first semester, and this semester we want it well above 95 percent. Please make sure that your scholar is present everyday.
Finally, please mark your calendars for the following Family Congresos:
Thursday, February 15th, 5:30-6:30
Thursday, March 15th, 5:30-6:30
Thursday, April 19th, 5:30-6:30
Thursday, May 17th, 5:30-6:30
Additionally, family teacher conferences will be held on Thursday, March 22nd, from 4-8pm. We will see you then!
In Partnership,
Jack Holmes, Principal
