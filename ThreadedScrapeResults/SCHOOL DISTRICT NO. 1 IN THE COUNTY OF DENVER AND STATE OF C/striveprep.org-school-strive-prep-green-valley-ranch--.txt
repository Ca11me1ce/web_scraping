Jessica Savage
Welcome to STRIVE Prep - Green Valley Ranch
We are thrilled to welcome students back the class of 2026 (8th grade) & 2027 (7th grade) and welcome our incoming class of 2028 (6th grade)!
This year we are excited about our continued focus on building a culture of literacy while challenging our students in all subject areas. Last year we had 27 students become “millionaires” reading over 1 million words during the school year! Our goal is for every student to make 2 years of growth in reading and math, ensuring that all students are on track to being prepared for college and a life of opportunities.
Be on the lookout for information regarding our family events this fall. This fall we are excited to host families for our 6th grade welcome breakfast, back to school night and parent council meetings. We will also reach out for support with field trips and hosting our fall dance!
Additionally we will kicking off our sports calendar with our fall sports. This fall we will be offering cross country, flag football and volleyball.
As always, thank you for your partnership. We are looking forward to working together this year!
- Jessica Savage, Principal
