KIPP Through College (KTC) is a part of the broader KIPP approach that aims to ensure that all students are prepared to succeed in college and live choice-filled lives. Through high school transition support, one-on-one college counseling, alumni advising for KIPPsters in college, and career readiness services, KIPP students go on to matriculate and graduate from high school and college, ready to begin their careers.  Ultimately, the vision of the KIPP Through College program is that all students have the access, skills and resources necessary to navigate to and through college into self-sufficient adulthood.
2,175 KIPP Students Served
Over 2,100 KIPP alumni receive college advising and career support.
85% College Matriculation
85% of the students who completed 8th grade with KIPP have gone on to attend college.
95% High School Graduation Rate
 95% of KIPP students graduate from high school.
80+ College Partnerships
KIPP has partnered with more than 80 colleges and universities across the country to ensure student success.
HOW KIPP THROUGH COLLEGE WORKS
In addition to the rigorous academic preparation that KIPP Bay Area Schools offers, the KIPP Through College program offers a range of services to KIPP Bay Area Schools alumni.
IN HIGH SCHOOL
The focus on college is even more intentional when KIPP Bay Area Schools students begin high school. While in high school, KIPP Through College provides support to students in the following areas: academic advising, standardized testing preparation, college tours, college admissions and application assistance, scholarship support, and financial literacy.
IN COLLEGE
KTC not only supports students on their journey to college, but also supports them while they work towards college graduation. KTC advisors visit students on their college campuses, as well as keep in touch via email and phone. Counselors discuss academic progress, financial aid, social pressures, and internship and career options. During holidays and breaks, KIPP hosts events for KIPPsters while they are back in their hometowns.

Career Readiness
KIPP Through College provides major exploration and career readiness support through our 1:1 advising model, College & Career Connections programming at KIPP high schools, annual Career Summit event for college-age alumni and a robust Alumni Internship Program (AIP) over the summer. 
Our career readiness programming provides exposure to the variety of careers available and develops the necessary knowledge, skills, mindsets and behaviors to be successful in professional environments.
Our Alumni Internship Program is a competitive summer experience that allows KIPP high school and college students to gain early “real-world” career exposure to help increase alumni interest and excitement around college persistence and their own career trajectory. 
Can your company or organization host a KIPP high school or college intern?
Currently, 96% of KIPP Bay Area alumni who participated in our Alumni Internship Program are persisting in college, have identified majors that align with their career interests and have increased their professional and social capital. Our partners have a unique opportunity to develop young talent and support our community by hosting a KIPP high school or college summer intern.
KIPP Through College is looking for host organizations who can:
a) Provide students with a meaningful opportunity at least two weeks or 50 hours in length during the summer months. Paid internships are preferred (approx. $13-15/hr), but unpaid opportunities are also available.
b) Assign a supervisor who will provide regular, constructive feedback to interns, complete formal evaluations and liaise with KIPP.
