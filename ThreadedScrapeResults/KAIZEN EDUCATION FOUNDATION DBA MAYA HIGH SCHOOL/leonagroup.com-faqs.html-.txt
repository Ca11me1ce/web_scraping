What is a charter school?
Charter schools are tuition-FREE public schools that enjoy increased  autonomy in exchange for higher accountability standards. Charter  schools not only have a school board, but also an authorizer that holds  them accountable. Charter schools do not have special entrance  requirements and do not charge tuition.
How much is tuition?

Leona Group schools

e accept ALL  students and do NOT discriminate based on educational disadvantage, race,  gender, economic status or any other factor.

How do I enroll my child?
The steps involved in  enrolling in a charter school vary a bit by state. In all of our  schools, a registration application is required, as are the same  documents you would need to provide to enroll in your traditional  district school. 
Is my child guaranteed a seat if I submit an enrollment application?
Leona Group schools accept all students, however space is limited. Leona schools abide by state rules regarding enrollment. In some states, spots are filled on a first-come-first-served basis; in others, there is an open enrollment period followed by a lottery.
