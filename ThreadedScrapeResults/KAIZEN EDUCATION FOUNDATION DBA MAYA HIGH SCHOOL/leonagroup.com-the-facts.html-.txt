What Are Charter Schools?
True or False?
​
​Charter schools are public schools of choice that have certain freedoms (such as hiring decisions, extending the school day or year, curricula) in exchange for greater accountability. Leona charter schools: 
• Are open to all children;
• Do not charge tuition; and
• Have no special entrance requirements.
Charter schools often offer specialized programs in response to community needs. Because they are more nimble, charters are able to quickly adjust to and address the current and emerging needs of its students.
​The Leona Group
The Leona Group provides comprehensive education management services to charter school boards and nonprofit organizations - at a small fraction of the cost that traditional schools pay for similar services. With Leona handling day-to-day operations, these entities are freed to focus on setting policy, mission and vision.
Leona Group charter schools:

• Maintain structure and student discipline to maintain a high-quality learning environment
• Hold students, parents, teachers and administration accountable for performance

FALSE
Charter schools are tuition-FREE public schools
Charter schools pick and choose students to "pad" academic performance. 
FALSE
Leona charter schools accept all children, regardless of 
economic or educational disadvantage, race or any other special requirement. In fact,  Leona schools serve a disproportionate number of young people who come from circumstances of poverty, neglect, dysfunction, violence and educational disadvantage. 
Charter schools are, at a minimum, held to the same academic expectations as traditional public schools. 
TRUE
In addition to meeting the same federal and state requirements of accountability, charter schools are judged on how they meet the student achievement goals set forth by their charter contracts. This is an added layer of accountability.
Special education services are available in Leona schools.
TRUE
Leona Group charter schools provide special education services in an inclusive environment. On average our schools service a percent of special education service similar to or above their traditional counterparts. 
​
Charter schools managed by Leona are “for profit” schools. 
FALSE
Leona charter schools are
 not for profit
 - and are doing much more with much less than their traditional counterparts. Leona charter schools receive no capital funding. Yet, unlike so many traditional districts, our schools are financially stable and many have healthy fund balances.
