Overview
High Standards and Quality Education
Since the establishment of LISA, we have continually striven towards maintaining the high academic standards that will powerfully propel us into the 21st century. Because of our supportive parents, the faculty and staff have guided our students beyond all community and state mandated expectations. The faculty, Staff and Administrators at LISA are caring, competent, dedicated and willing to assist you. We are working very hard to provide the best possible learning climate to our students.
Our Commitment
The faculty and staff at LISA Academy diligently work to mold responsive, productive, and civic-minded individuals. The 1:12 faculty-student ratio ensures a "hands on approach" with attention placed on the details. Because there are no more than 32 students per class, each class has an opportunity to become a prolific community. The LISA faculty and staff have the profound privilege of inspiring our students to follow their dreams while making the world a better place for themselves and others.
Discipline with Character
The character education program not only instills in our students values such as accountability, compassion, integrity, tolerance and leadership, but also reaffirms our strength as a drug free, gang-free, peer pressure-free, bully-free, truancy-free, fight-free and crime-free campus.
Parent/Guardian & Community Involvement
By visiting students and their families at home, our teachers help build strong communication and a caring classroom. Teachers talk about student progress, programs and planning; parents provide priceless feedback and input; and students improve both academically and socially.
Parent/Guardian Login
Access online from home or work to check your child's grades, homework, conduct, attendance, and notes from teachers. Monitor your child's progress on daily basis.
Communication and Safety
The school communicates with parents via email, telephone, the Wednesday Envelope, and its comprehensive web site. By communicating quickly, the Administration at LISA sees to the progress, high attendance and safety of students.
Music and Drama
Students enjoy playing the English flute and piano keyboards and activities such as talent shows, school dances, and performances at school.
Field Trips and Fun Activities
LISA campuses are proud to have plenty of opportunities for students to learn from real-life experiences and broaden their horizons through field trips. These outings include visits to local museums, science centers, non-profit organizations and higher education institutions. We also encourage a culture of learning and a family-like environment, where students and staff celebrate one another’s achievements and milestones. We have regular events that showcase the extensive talent we have within our halls. 
Advanced Academic Services
LISA assures an array of learning opportunities that are commensurate with abilities of gifted/talented students: The school-wide enrichment model (SEM), special summer and Saturday programs, mentoring, ability grouping, independent study and research projects, and enhancement programs for creativity and thinking skills.
Science & Technology Projects
Science Fair is a tradition at LISA schools. Every student is required to do a research project. Research project is an enrichment activity, a family experience, and early start to academic work, an opportunity to develop a portfolio, a reference for the best colleges, and a way to establish connections.
After School Clubs
We offer clubs in after school program such as Arts and Crafts, Basketball, Computer Programming, Board Games, Movie, Math Counts, Journalism and Music.
