Dear Prospective Parents/Guardians,
First and foremost, we would like to thank you for your interest in our schools. We are pleased that you are considering our school for your child's educational needs.
LISA Academy is high performing K-12 college preparatory charter school system focusing on math, science, engineering, and computer technologies. For more than a decade, our schools have provided students from our community the opportunity to excel in their studies in a safe and nurturing environment.
LISA Academy have academic programs that would cater the needs of all diverse students. Our campuses have special education, section 504, English as a second language, gifted and talented programs. Additionally, if you need any further information about our school's programs, please schedule an appointment with the school administrators. If you need any language assistance, please contact our school registrar as language translation services are available.
Our student body, faculty, and parents are a healthy patchwork of different races, religions, abilities and ethnic backgrounds. The diversity at LISA provides an opportunity for children of all backgrounds to experience and embrace different cultures and lifestyles.
We hope that you will schedule a visit to one of our three campuses and let the school speak for itself. If you want to learn more about our schools and educational programs, you may attend one of our open house sessions which are held in January or February of each school year. This is a great opportunity to tour the school, speak with some of the parents and meet our staff. Please contact individual schools to find out the open house dates.
LISA follows the following admission process. LISA requires applicants to submit a complete application form in order to be considered for admission. This can be done through campus websites or a paper application can be submitted to the campus. A lottery is to be conducted if the number of applicants exceeds the maximum enrollment and a waiting list is developed. As space become available, applicants will be called from the waiting list beginning with applicants with the lowest number assignment.
Thank you for your interest in LISA Academy. We look forward to sharing with you the difference our school makes in the lives of children and families.
Sincerely yours, 								
LISA administration
