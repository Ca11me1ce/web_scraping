LISA Academy  follows the following admission process according to applicable LISA admission and enrollment policies. LISA Academy requires applicants to submit a complete application form in order to be considered for admission. A lottery is to be conducted if the number of applicants exceeds the maximum enrollment and a waiting list is developed. As space become available, applicants will be called from the waiting list beginning with applicants with the lowest number assignment.
Lottery Procedures and Date when a grade or class is oversubscribed
A lottery is to be conducted if the number of applicants exceeds the maximum enrollment. The lottery shall take place within fifteen days after the closing date of the application period. The lottery will be conducted via lottery selection software. The principal or designee of each campus will conduct the computerized lottery. This ensures that the winner list and the waiting list are selected randomly.
Development of a Waiting List
The lottery will be paused momentarily after the computerized lottery fills all available seats allowed by the enrollment cap. The drawing will then continue, and the randomly-selected numbers will be used to create a waiting list. As space become available, applicants will be called from the waiting list beginning with applicants with the lowest number assignment.
Admission Process of Returning Students
Returning students (students who currently attended the school and intend to return the next school year) are given priority in admission, if they notify the school of their intent to return for the next school year by February 1st of the each school year.
Siblings Policy and Children of the School's Founders and Employees
Siblings of returning students currently enrolled at a LISA campus and who timely notify the school of their intent to return for the next school year are exempt from the lottery and, space permitting, are automatically enrolled. For this policy "sibling" shall mean a biological or legally adopted brother or sister residing in the same household as the applicant. Cousins, nieces, nephews and unrelated children sharing an address with the applicant are not siblings. Sibling enrollment is dependent on available space and does not guarantee enrollment of each listed sibling. 
Children of the school's founders, teachers, and staff (so long as the total number of students allowed constitutes only a small percentage of the total enrollment) are exempt from lottery requirements, as permitted by federal guidance on the Charter Schools Program.
Applications that are submitted outside of the designated application period
If a student applies to the school outside of the designated application period, the student will be placed on a waiting list in the order of the date in which the application is received.
Students with documented histories of a criminal offense and/or misconduct
Students who have a documented history of a criminal offense or juvenile court adjudication will be excluded from enrollment. Students who have been expelled from other schools or districts may not enroll in the LISA Academy.
Documents and Information Applicants are Required to Provide
Applicants must submit a completed application form in order to be considered for admission. The application form must be signed and dated by the parent(s). The application form must include the following items:
Applicant's name (first, last, and middle names)
Applicant's birth date
Applicant's current grade level and grade applied for
Applicant's residential address
Phone numbers
Applicant's current school and district names
Applicant's parents' name and signature
Whether the applicant has a sibling already admitted to attending the school
Whether the applicant has a documented history of a criminal offense, a juvenile court adjudication, or discipline problems 
Applicants are not required to provide transcript or other academic records until after they are offered admission.
