Muffins with Moms
 May 02, 2018
To celebrate Mother's Day and to honor the special role that moms and maternal figures have in our students' lives we would like to invite our students' moms to the school on Monday, May 14th to join students in their classrooms for muffins.
Moms can visit their elementary children in their rooms at 7:45 AM. Middle-high school children can be visited at 8:00 AM. There will be a performance by Ms. Crace's class in the cafeteria at 8:15 AM.
Moms who arrive early will have to wait in the lobby, so we strongly encourage participants to not arrive until 7:45 (for elementary) or 8:00 (for middle/high). Students may arrive to school a little late with their moms. Once moms arrive they can check in and see what room their child is in and where the room is. Moms with multiple children at the school are free to go from class to class to visit them but students will have to remain in their assigned location. 
Please fill out the following RSVP just once per family.
