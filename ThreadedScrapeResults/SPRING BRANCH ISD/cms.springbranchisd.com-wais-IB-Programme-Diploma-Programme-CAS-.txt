About CAS
The CAS requirement is a fundamental part of the programme and takes seriously the importance of life outside the world of scholarship, providing a refreshing counterbalance to academic studies.
CAS aims to develop students who are:
reflective thinkers—they understand their own strengths and limitations, identify goals and devise strategies for personal growth
willing to accept new challenges and new roles
aware of themselves as members of communities with responsibilities towards each other and the environment
active participants in sustained, collaborative projects
balanced—they enjoy and find significance in a range of activities involving intellectual, physical, creative and emotional experiences.
Creativity, Action, Service:
Creativity is interpreted broadly to include a wide range of activities that involve creative thinking. Creativity provides students with the opportunity to explore their own sense of original thinking and expression.
Action is focussed on getting involved in physical exertion that contributes to a healthy lifestyle. The aim of Action is to promote lifelong healthy habits related to physical well-being.
Service requires students to understand their capacity to make a meaningful contribution to their community and society. Through Service, students develop and apply personal and social skills in real-life situations involving decision-making, problem solving, initiative, responsibility, and accountability for their actions.
