Individuals & Societies
Individuals and Societies aims to encourage students to respect and understand the world around them, and to provide a skill base to facilitate further study. This is achieved through the study of individuals, societies and environments in a wide context: historical, contemporary, geographical, political, social, economic, religious, technological and cultural. Within the aims and objectives, students must develop skills to address concepts of time, place and space, change, systems, and global awareness, as well as a technical, analytical, decision-making and investigative skills.
