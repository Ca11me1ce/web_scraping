Physical & Health
Physical & Health
Physical and health education focuses on both learning about and learning through physical activity. Both dimensions help students to develop approaches to learning (ATL) skills across the curriculum. Physical and health education contributes a unique perspective to the development of the attributes of the IB learner profile, promoting the health of individuals and communities. 
Students will take Physical & Health classes throughout 6th-8th grade. Due to the number of hours electives meet, 6th Grade students will also select a Physical & Health topic for the Interim Semester during International Investigations Workshops.

In the IB MYP, students are assessed on an 8-point scale across 4 criteria. In Physical & Health Education, the criteria are Knowing & Understanding, Planning for Performance, Applying & Performing, Reflecting & Improving Performance. 
We use a standardized chart to convert the 0-8 IB MYP grades into the percentage grades used by Spring Branch. For more information about Physical & Health Education in the IB MYP, please see the 
Physical & Health Education Subject Brief
