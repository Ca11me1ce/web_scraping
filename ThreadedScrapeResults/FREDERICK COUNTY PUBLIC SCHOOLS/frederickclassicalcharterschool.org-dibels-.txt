DIBELS Test Results
The Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS) Next is a set of short fluency measures used to regularly monitor the development of foundational literacy skills.  Benchmark testing occurs three times a year with grade level materials. Student performance and development of literacy skills are progressed monitored every two to three weeks for all students who are at some risk or at risk.  It is important to note that Frederick Classical Charter School uses the new recommended benchmark goals.  These goals more reliably identify students who need additional support in order to become proficient readers.  Recommended goals increase the benchmark expectations at each grade level.   They are directly connected to an external literacy assessment, SAT 10. If you have any questions, please contact our Literacy Specialist at 240-236-1200.  More information can be found here:
