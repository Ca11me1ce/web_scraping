"The beginning is the most important part of the work." -- Plato
How We Started
Good things are often born of struggle, and our school is no different.  In late 2009, a group of parents concerned about the emphasis in the public schools began meeting to discuss starting a charter school that would emphasize traditional content that was taught using research-based curricula.  Our group continued to meet for the remainder of the year, and then in early 2010 we announced our intention to create the Frederick Classical Charter School.  The 
application 
for the charter school was submitted to the Board in the summer of 2010.  After several years of hurdles, in April 2012 the Board of Education approved our school to open in August 2013.  The exhausting years of effort and the many sacrifices made by our founding families inspired our motto--Nil Sine Magno Labore--nothing without great labor.
Nil Sine Magno Labore - The School Song
Our music teacher, Lori Bowers, wrote our school song. Here is the 
audio of a student performance
 of our school song from October 2013.
School Interest and Information Nights
Throughout the school year, FCCS holds meetings for potential students and parents to introduce them to the classical model of instruction and explain the enrollment process.  For more information about enrollment and upcoming Information Nights, visit the
