The Frederick Classical Charter School offers a warm, inviting atmosphere where students are expected to comport themselves well and strive to meet high standards of academic excellence.  We aim to educate "Renaissance men and women", who have  a wide range of knowledge about all subjects and understand how each relates to the others.  The design of the classical curriculum, which is based on teaching history in a chronological sequence, is unique among education approaches and achieves a high level of integration among subjects that is a hallmark of classical education.
Parents' Guide to Classical Education
For an excellent introduction to classical education, please
 read the following booklet
 by Dr. Christopher Perrin.  It is important to note that our school's approach is not religious in any way and this guide was originally written for a religious school.  The references in the guide that pertain to religious instruction do not apply to our school.  Additionally, we teach Latin in grades 4-6 and our logic stage begins in fifth grade. Despite those differences, however, this guide offers the best introduction to classical education that we have found, and we think parents will find it useful for that purpose.
Excerpts from our application
 are available here
