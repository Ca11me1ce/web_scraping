The foundation of our educational program consists of three pillars; Academics,  Character, and Service.
We believe that every adult in our building is responsible for every scholar in our school and their academic success. Every scholar can and must achieve to his highest level. It is our responsibility to figure out how to make each scholar achieve at his highest level. We personalize the educational experience for every scholar. We teach each scholar in each subject to mastery. We prepare our scholars to be successful in a range of post high school endeavors. Scholars will be prepared to be successful in a college or technical training environment. The goal is 100% college acceptance for our scholars.
Building character in young men will not happen by accident. Building character must be strategic and intentional. Theodore Roosevelt said “To educate a person in mind and not morals is to educate a menace to society.” Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said, “We must remember that intelligence is not enough. Intelligence plus character – that is the goal of true education.” Many of our scholars are just growing up not being educated to function as men of character. It is vital, in order for them to be a leader and an asset to our society, for them to be men of competence and character.
 Service to our community is the first step in leadership in our community. As scholars learn to serve, the value of our community becomes more apparent to them. The best way for our scholars to learn to serve the community is for them to engage in the act of service itself. Our scholars will improve the quality of our community through their acts of service.
