Coach Merrell has served as AD at Smith Academy since 2013. He has previously served as AD and head varsity basketball coach at several other schools in Indiana. During his coaching career, he has amassed nearly 500 wins making him one of the winningest active coaches in the state of Indiana. He has also led teams to multiple sectional and regional championships as well as a state championship appearance.
Smith Academy is proud to provide our scholars with a high quality athletic program. We are full members of the Indiana High School Athletic Association (IHSAA) and we compete according to the rules and regulations set by the IHSAA.
Basketball
We were thrilled to compete in our first season and post-season as full members of the IHSAA. Go Fighting 54th!
Cross Country
The Smith Academy cross country team competed in it's first ever sectional in 2017. The school is excited about the future of the cross country program as the team continues to grow and expand. 
Track and Field
We are excited about competing in the 2018 track and field season and competing in our first IHSAA state tournament!
Football
SAFE has participated in a flag football league and we are prepared to field our first full contact team.
"...my 9th grade son and his freshmen 
basketball team played your 9th grade team twice. Both times, I was extremely impressed with how your team played and how the coaches handled themselves. Regardless of what happened in the games, your student athletes showed tremendous heart, did not complain and played with humble enthusiasm. It was really refreshing! I congratulate 
the coaches, faculty, teachers and students at the Smith Academy for all you're doing and the excellent way in which you're doing it! I wish for you all great success!”
