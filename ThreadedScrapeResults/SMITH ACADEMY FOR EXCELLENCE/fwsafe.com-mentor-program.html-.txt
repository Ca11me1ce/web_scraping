Mission
-To help students recognize their Power.  We endeavor to walk with each student, helping to develop their natural abilities to influence persons, situations, and environments for good.
-To help students develop and maintain a Loving intent as the motive for their actions.
-To help students develop a Sound Mind - the requisite skills to think deeply and inquire sincerely, so as to live and lead confidently.
​
Peer Mentoring: Elementary Grades
Along with the 6-12 program, SAFE also offers a peer mentoring program. In this program, select high school scholars take on the responsibility and the honor of mentoring elementary scholars. In this program, our older scholars learn to lead and our younger scholars have the opportunity to learn from someone who is responsible and experienced but not too far removed from their own age.
