Service learning and community service initiatives play an extremely important role 
 in reaching our goal of long-term holistic success for our SAFE scholars. With 
 SAFE scholars regularly engaging in community service experiences, they
 learn many important life lessons in a positive environment that cannot be 
 taught in the traditional classroom alone. Service projects are recommended 
 by members of the staff, scholars and members of the community. By connecting 
 service learning to the classroom instruction, our young men gain and 
 maintain an increased level of engagement within the classroom. 
Service learning also helps to create ties between school and the community. 
By sharing responsibilities of the community with other area organizations, 
businesses, and institutions, scholars develop relationships with people they may 
not otherwise cross paths with. This promotes further accountability among the 
scholars and a sense of responsibility to continue their education.
