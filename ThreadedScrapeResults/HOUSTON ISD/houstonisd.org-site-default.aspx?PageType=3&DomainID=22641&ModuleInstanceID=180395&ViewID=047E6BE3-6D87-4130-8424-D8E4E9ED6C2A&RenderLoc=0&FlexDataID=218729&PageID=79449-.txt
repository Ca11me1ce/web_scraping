HISD students and staff are doing amazing things every day. The good news may include awards and recognition for faculty and staff such as Principal of the Year, Teacher of the Year, or HEB Excellence in Education Awards. For students, it could be one of our students getting a perfect score on the ACT test or being named Houston’s Youth Poet Laureate. We will also let you know when our students or our schools receive prizes, donations, or grants – and when our community and business partners give generously to enrich our students’ learning experience. When HISD departments are honored by state or national organizations, we will share the news with you right here. Be sure to check back often to keep up with how HISD is building Houston’s future, right now.
