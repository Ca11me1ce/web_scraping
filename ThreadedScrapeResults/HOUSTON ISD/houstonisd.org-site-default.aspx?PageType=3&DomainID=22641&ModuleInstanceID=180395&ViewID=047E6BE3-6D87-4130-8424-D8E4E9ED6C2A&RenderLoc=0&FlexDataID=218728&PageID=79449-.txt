 Resources and social services to support the whole child
Through the 
Every Community Every School
 initiative, HISD is connecting schools to non-academic supports and community resources to improve the well-being and academic achievement of all students. Often called wraparound services, these non-academic supports address challenges that can have adverse effects on a student’s readiness and ability to learn. When provided in tandem with strong academics and high-quality teaching, schools can truly meet the needs of the whole child.
