What is a tax credit?
A tax credit is a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the actual tax owed to the State of Arizona. It reduces your tax liability to the state by the amount you donate, up to $400 for married couples and up to $200 for single filers. The tax credit is available to all Arizona Individuals who pay state income taxes, regardless of whether or not they have children in school.
In accordance with Federal Law, Leading Edge Academy does not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, sex, or disability.
