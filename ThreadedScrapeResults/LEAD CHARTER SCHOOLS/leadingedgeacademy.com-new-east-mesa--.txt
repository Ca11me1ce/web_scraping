Join the Family!
In the popular movie Lilo and Stitch, Lilo says: “‘Ohana means family. Family means no one is left behind – or forgotten.” Ohana is a great way to describe the atmosphere at Leading Edge East Mesa.  We are a family. Our parents are highly involved at the campus, and no one is left behind or forgotten.
We are a K-6 campus with small class sizes, a safe, wholesome environment, traditional values, and school uniforms. Our campus feels much like a private school – except we are a tuition-free charter school. We invite you to join the East Mesa family!
Leading a Generation to Excellence.
“Our goal is to promote academic achievement in a safe, supportive, and caring learning environment as we develop students of character.” 
-Chad Kobold, Principal
History
Founded in 2002 by Delmer Geesey, a pastor with the vision of starting a top-notch traditional education program, Leading Edge Academy schools began with 17 students. Through word of mouth by satisfied parents, the school began to grow each year. In 2007 The Leading Edge Charter Network took this successful format and expanded to East Mesa. The Leading Edge Charter Network continues to expand and currently has school sites in East Mesa, Queen Creek, Gilbert and Maricopa.
“I would give 10 stars if I could! LEA at East Mesa is the BEST decision I have ever made for my children! I am beyond happy with this school in every way. The staff is wonderful, always going above and beyond for the students and parents. I was not surprised a bit when they received an “A” rating last year, they make sure every single student gets the help they need to succeed. I wouldn’t dream of putting my children in any other school!”
