Principal’s Note
I am very fortunate  and excited to serve all of our students attending the Leading Edge Academy Gilbert campus. We at the Academy, are very proud of our excellent teachers and staff. They will deliver a rigorous and relevant curriculum designed to prepare students for the challenges they will face in the 21st century. It will also be our duty to help each and every student be successful in their academic pursuits. 
We believe that all students can become independent lifelong learners and we will assist them in that effort throughout their years at the LEA Gilbert Early College campus. Citizenship and character is the foundation of our school and students are expected to take responsibility for their own learning. Students will have opportunities to  participate in seminars based on character and ethics as well as be involved in a community service program. 
As part of the Leading Edge team, please feel free to share concerns, questions, and successes with our staff. We are here to help ensure all of our students have a successful school experience and that our families feel supported and part of the educational process.
Sincerely,
Dr. Gerald D. Slemmer
