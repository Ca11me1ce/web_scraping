I  couldn't be happier with my daughter's academic progress. Marshall  Academy has proven to provide the right balance of discipline and  academic expectations to develop students into intelligent, respectful  human beings. In addition, the Academy realizes the importance of  socialization and parent involvement and provides several social  gatherings throughout the year for students and their families to  attend.

Ten  years ago, our family chose Marshall Academy because of the quality of  education and the right environment.  We're grateful we made this choice  as we approach our son's graduation this year.  He is a better person  because of what he learned from the teachers,

I  am excited for what Marshall Academy has prepared my daughter to do and  become. I will continue to speak highly of Marshall Academy and  recommend it at every opportunity. I firmly believe that Marshall  Academy's traditional focus, strong foundation in fundamentals, and the  emphasis placed on the seven universal virtues, afford the absolute best  educational base and character developing environment on which to build  for the future.

The  classical education our children are receiving at Marshall Academy  fosters a love of learning and the invaluable ability to think for  themselves. The environment is safe, nurturing and respectful with a  strong sense of community, one that we are so happy to be a part of.

I just wanted to say thank you again for teaching us all the ways on how to write a paper! I have some students in my class that don't even know 5 paragraph essay format, MLA, or APA!! I am proud to see I know what they are! Only because my AMAZING English teacher taught me the ways of writing! Many of my professors say, "Wow, you are a great writer!" They are always pretty amazed at how my paper is well written and formatted the right way.
