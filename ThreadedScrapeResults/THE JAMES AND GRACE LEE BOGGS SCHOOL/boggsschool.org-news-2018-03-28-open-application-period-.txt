Our open-application period is April 1-30, 2018 for the 2018-19 school year! NOTE: We will be closed through April 8 for Spring Break. Applications will be available for download from our website starting April 1; they can be picked up and dropped off (or mailed) from the 9th through the 30th. All applications received during that time (by mail or in person) will be considered with equal weight, with exceptions for siblings of currently enrolled students and children of staff and board members receiving priority (see
