The People’s Prince
Born on March 26, 1871 Jonah Kuhio Kalanianaʻole was prince of the reigning House of Kalakaua when the Kingdom of Hawaii was overthrown in 1893.
Prince Kūhiō was raised in Kōloa on the island of Kauaʻi and attended the Royal School on Oʻahu, originally called the Chief’s Children School. He studied for four years at St. Matthew’s College in California, the royal Agricultural College in England, and then eventually graduated from a business school also in England.
Upon the assumption of the Kalākaua dynasty to the throne of the Hawaiian Kingdom in 1884, a proclamation ending the Kamehameha Dynasty also declared Kūhiō a royal prince. King David Kalākaua, also Kūhiō’s uncle, then appointed him to a seat in the royal Cabinet administering the Department of the Interior. However,
American businessmen overthrew the Hawaiian kingdom in 1893. A year later, Kūhiō and brother Kawānanakoa joined other native Hawaiians in an attempt to restore the monarchy. The attempt was unsuccessful, and Prince Kūhiō was sentenced to a year in prison while others were executed for treason against the republic. After getting out of prison, Kuhio left Hawaiʻi and traveled in South Africa for a few years, vowing never to return to a Hawaiʻi that appeared inhospitable to Hawaiians. During his time away from home, he joined the British Army to fight in the Boer War.

After returning home, Hawaiʻi had already been annexed as territory of the United States. Had the Hawaiian monarchy continued, Prince Kuhio probably would have become King of Hawaii upon the death of Queen Liliuokalani. Instead, he was elected as Hawai`I congressional delegate for ten consecutive terms.
Kūhiō was often called Ke Aliʻi Makaʻāinana (“Prince of the People”), and is well-known for his efforts to preserve and strengthen the Hawaiian people. While a delegate of Congress, he spearheaded the effort in the passage of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act that provides lands for native Hawaiians to homestead. Prince Kūhiō was also known for restoring the Royal Order of Kamehameha I and establishing the Hawaiian Civic Club.
Prince Kūhiō served in Congress from 1903 till his death in 1922. His body was laid to rest with the rest of his royal family at the Royal Mausoleum in Nuʻuanu on Oʻahu.
Celebrating Prince Kūhiō
A new statue honoring Prince Kūhiō was dedicated in 2002. The statue is slightly larger than life-size, and is located in Waikīkī. The Territorial Legislature passed a resolution in 1949, establishing March 26th as a Territorial holiday in honor of Prince Kūhiō.
