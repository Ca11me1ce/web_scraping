NEW!!!  Mahalo for your interest in Kawaikini Public Charter School. The limited spaces in grades 7 and 8 have been filled. For more details about Kawaikini, please call the office or call ʻAlohilani Rogers at 632-2032.
Establishing innovative ways for the community to participate in, and contribute to the school is a key element of Kawaikini’s implementation of its vision. Such contributions can be made at the board level, the parent level and in the classroom in the form of guest lectures, community mentorships and hands-on projects guided by kupuna and other community volunteers. Community and parental involvement strengthens Kawaikini’s foundation by expanding its reach and role in the community.
