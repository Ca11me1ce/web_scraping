From Our Director
Aloha,
Kanu o ka ʻĀina Learning Ohana (KALO) provides financial support for multiple educational programs: Kanu o ka ʻĀina NCPCS, Mālamapōkiʻi (Early Childhood Education), Kahoʻiwai - Center for Adult Teaching and Learning Programs (Post Secondary Programs), and Nā Lei Naʻauʻao (NLN) Alliance for Native Hawaiian Education across the state of Hawaiʻi. 
KALO strives to provide these organizations with an environment of excellence through Education with Aloha; however, public Department of Education funding does not provide enough resources to meet our programmatic needs. Our families end up with school-associated expenses that they often are not able to afford. This is where we look to you for help. 
Uniforms, healthy lunches, technology, school supplies, and after school programs are part of an environment we believe help children achieve in a competitive classroom and develop habits that will enable life-long academic success.
Your donation helps ALL of our programs at KALO!
Mahalo Nui Loa,
Taffi Wise 
Executive Director, KALO
