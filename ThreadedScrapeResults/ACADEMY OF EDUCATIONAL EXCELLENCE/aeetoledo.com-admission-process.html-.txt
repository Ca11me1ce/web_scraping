Excellence is in our name
At the Academy of Educational Excellence we are proud to provide our students with the opportunity to learn alongside a diverse group of children and families who reflect the racial, cultural and socio-economic diversity of communities surrounding our school.  Our standards-based program provides an academically challenging, creative and emotional supportive environment for our students and is designed to continually expands student’s knowledge and understanding of concepts, ideas and information.  The educational philosophy, called constructivism, is the cornerstone of our instructional delivery at AEE.  We offer our students the strategies for gathering information, a classroom climate of shared inquiry, and hands-on experiences making use of a variety of materials.  Teachers design projects to promote collaboration between students, connect concepts  between curricular areas, and anchor state standards in meaningful contexts like those students will experience in their lives beyond the classroom.  Projects will be shared with our community in performances, simulations, art shows, and  displays as we celebrate together the continuing joy of lifelong learning.
​
Definitely AEE is designed for families who are seeking innovation in education. Through our   Personalized Learning Model, students participate in enrichment classes in the core subject areas of      language arts, math, social studies and science.  We offer a wide range of programs plus onsite intervention and enrichment curricula, including technological   resources.  The school provides high-quality and state adopted  curricula. During the 2014-15 academic year the school’s progress was rated with an A, showing that our students learning growth went up by two years.  During the 2015-2016 school year our AYP was rated in B.
