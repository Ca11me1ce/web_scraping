OUR TIME WITH MURIEL SUMMERS
​          Our Staff welcomed Muriel Summers to AEE on August 1st and 2nd. Our teachers, administrators and other staff received training on THE 7 Habits of Highly Successful People.
 It was a touching experience, a time for inner reflection and a great opportunity for Professional Development.
           We Thank Ms. Summers for taking time out of her busy schedule to train our team. This experience has touched each and every one of our hearts. Our students will highly benefit from the time that we 
spent with Ms.  Summers. 
​-How do The 7 Habits shape The Leader in ME? ​       
           Content from The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People is a key component of the overall The Leader in Me process. The 7 Habits is a synthesis of universal, timeless principles of personal and interpersonal effectiveness, such as responsibility, vision, integrity, teamwork, collaboration and renewal, which are secular in nature and common to all people and cultures.
In addition, we thank Mrs. Ann Harris for ending our training session with an elegantly sung solo, and we also thank Dr. Koppisch for our beautiful Tree of Life jewelry.  
cELEBRATING 6 YEARS
A
t AEE we are celebrating the 6th anniversary of our foundation. All our staff members at AEE have gone through a profound study of our students needs and due to these results we are launching a transformation that will bring opportunities for academic growth and in all areas of development. Our Governing Board has approved to have our school start The Leader in Me program. This program will provide our school with the vision and language to lead the school in a way that addresses all areas of development. As each child discovers and develops his or her unique gifts and talents, they will be given opportunities to lead. As leaders, they become active, engaged partners in their own education and their self-confidence, responsibility, and initiative grows. The children quickly understand the benefits of different gifts and talents; they learn to listen to new ideas, work together to achieve results, and motivate one another to be the best. We hope your school enjoys sharing these new opportunities. Together, you will watch each and every child grow throughout the year.
