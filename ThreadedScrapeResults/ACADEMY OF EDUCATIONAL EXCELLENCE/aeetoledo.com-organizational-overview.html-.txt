ORGANIZATIONAL OVERVIEW
ACADEMY OF EDUCATIONAL EXCELLENCE:  HOME OF THE MIGHTY PENGUINS
AEE ORGANIZATIONAL OVERVIEW
At the Academy of Educational Excellence we are proud to provide our students with the opportunity to learn alongside a diverse group of children and families who
 reflect the racial, cultural and socio--economic diversity of communities surrounding our school.
Our standards-based program provides an academically challenging, creative and emotional supportive environment for our students and is designed to continually expand student's knowledge and understanding of concepts, ideas and information.
The educational philosohy, called Constructivism, is the cornerstone of our instructional delivery at AEE.
We offer our students the strategies for gathering information, a classroom climate of shared inquiry, and hands-on experiences making use of a variety of materials.  Teachers design projects to promote collaboration between students, connect concepts between curricular areas, and anchor state standards in meaningful contexts like those students will experience in their lives beyond the classroom.   Projects are shared with our community in performances, simulations, art shows, music programs and displays that can be seen all over the school hallways and town center.
AEE is designed for families who are seeking innovation in education.
Through our differentiated instructional program we promote personalized learning among our students.
We offer a wide range of programs plus onsite intervention and enrichment curricula, including technological resources.
What is a Charter School?
A charter school is an independently run public school granted greater flexibility in its operations, in return for greater accountability for performance.  They are funded with public monies just like other public schools.  However, they are not held to some of the laws, regulations, and guidelines as regular public schools.  The "charter" establishing each school is a performance contract detailing the school's mission, program, students served, performance goals, and methods of assessment.
Who authorizes charter schools?
﻿
In Ohio, charter schools are authorized by a sponsor organization who responds directly to the Ohio Department of Education.
What are some benefits with charter schools?
Creators of charter schools believe that they increase learning opportunities and provide greater access for a quality education. Many people also enjoy the choice within the public school system for both parents and students.  Proponents say that charter schools provide a system of accountability for results within public education.
Who can attend charter schools?
Students in charter schools have similar demographic characteristics to students in the local public schools.  Most charter schools serve significantly higher percentages of minority or low-income students than the traditional public schools.
