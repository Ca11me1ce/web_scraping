 DR. ISRAEL I. KOPPISCH
Dear Parents and/or Guardians:
Thank you for selecting the Academy of Educational Excellence for your child.  We are very excited about our sixth school year to start in August 2017.
At the Academy of Educational Excellence we are proud to provide our students with the opportunity to learn alongside a diverse group of children and families who reflect the racial, cultural and socio--economic diversity of communities surrounding our school.  Our standards-based program provides an academically challenging, creative and emotional supportive environment for our students and is designed to continually expand student's knowledge and understanding of concepts, ideas and information.
Our educational philosophy is based on the development of the seven habits of a successful leader, which is the cornerstone of our instructional delivery at AEE.  We offer our students the strategies for gathering information, a classroom climate of shared inquiry, and hands-on experiences making use of a variety of materials.  Teachers design projects to promote collaboration between students, connect concepts between curricular areas, and anchor state standards in meaningful contexts like those students will experience in their lives beyond the classroom.
We encourage our parents to maintain an active role in their child's education.  As a growing school, we welcome your comments, feedback or questions you may have.
The 2017-2018 school year projects as an exciting year for our students and staff members.  Our school moved in 2016 to its new building location at 728 Parkside Boulevard, Toledo, Ohio (the old St. Hyacinth Catholic School). The building itself promotes an environment for active learning.  In addition to our basic educational curriculum we offer an enrichment program including:  Visual Arts, Music, Physical Education, Technology, Boys Scouts, Girl Scouts and the Drumlines Program. 
Welcome to our school year!
Dr. Israel Irizarry--Koppisch

The mightY Penguins 
Now you see it, now you don't. Aggressive yet gentle, outgoing but shy, stable yet flighty - everyone sees the penguin in a different way. It's that black and white thing: the penguin only reveals the side that it wants you to see. So whether you like this darling-devil or not, you have to concede that it's a fascinating and enigmatic individual.
Penguins are birds condemned to live out their days on the ground. Unable to fly, their excess energy has no outlet save their creative talents and emotional outbursts. 
​Penguins are poetic, artistic, and intellectually gifted, and as writers penguins have no equal. But, if unable to channel their impulses in a positive way, the resulting turmoil proves damaging to their relationships and careers.
Penguins are deceptively intelligent and are particularly animated when intellectually challenged. 
They excel at word games and puzzles but are modest about their abilities and are generally underestimated by others.
With a natural aptitude for languages, penguin personalities dominate the world of publishing as writers, editors and journalists. A strong sense of drama draws them to the theater and cinema, although unlike typical bird personalities they avoid the spotlight unless they're able to hide behind the characters they play. Once on stage however, they prove to be excellent performers with their multifaceted personalities conveying the full gamut of emotions.
