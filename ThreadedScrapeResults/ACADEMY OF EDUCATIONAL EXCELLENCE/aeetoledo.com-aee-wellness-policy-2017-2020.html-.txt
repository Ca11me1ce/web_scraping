AEE WELLNESS POLICY 2017-2020
ACADEMY OF EDUCATIONAL EXCELLENCE
WELLNESS POLICY
Approved by Governing Board  2017-2019
Whereas, children need access to healthful foods and opportunities to be physically active in order to grow, learn, and thrive:
Whereas, good health fosters student attendance and education;
Whereas, obesity rates have doubled in children and tripled in adolescents over the last two decades, and physical inactivity and excessive calorie intake are the predominant causes of obesity;
Whereas, heart disease, cancer, stroke, and diabetes are responsible for two-thirds of deaths in the United States, and major risk factors for those diseases, including unhealthy eating habits, physical inactivity, and obesity, often are established in childhood;
Whereas, only 2% of children (2 to 19 years) eat a healthy diet consistent with the five main recommendations from the Food Guide Pyramid;
Whereas, nationally, the items most commonly sold from school vending machines, school stores, and snack bars include low-nutrition foods and beverages, such as soda, sports drinks, imitation fruit juices, chips, candy, cookies, and snack cakes;
Whereas, school districts around the country are facing significant fiscal and scheduling constraints; and
Whereas; community participation is essential to the development and implementation of successful school wellness policies;
Thus, the Academy of Educational Excellence School District is committed to providing a school environment that promotes and protects children’s health, well-being and ability to learn by supporting healthy eating and physical activity. Therefore, it is the policy of the Academy of Educational Excellence School District that:
• The school district will engage students, parents, teachers, food service and health professionals, and other interested community members in developing, implementing, monitoring, and reviewing district-wide nutrition and physical activity policies.
 • All students in grades K-6th will have opportunities, support, and encouragement to be physically active on a regular basis.
 • Foods and beverages served at school will meet the nutrition recommendations of the U.S. Dietary Guidelines for Americans.
• Qualified child nutrition professionals will provide students with access to a variety of affordable, nutritious, and appealing foods that meet the health and nutrition needs of students; will accommodate the religious ethnic, and cultural diversity of the student body in meal planning; and will provide clean, safe, and pleasant settings and adequate time for students to eat.
• To the maximum extent practicable, the Academy of Educational Excellence will participate in available federal school meal programs (including the School Breakfast Program, National School Lunch Program [including After-school snacks], Summer food Service Program, Fruit and Vegetable Snack Program, and Child and Adult Care Food Program [including suppers]).
• The school will provide nutrition education and physical education to foster lifelong habits of healthy eating and physical activity, and will establish linkages between health education and school meal programs, and with related community services.
Module 1
NUTRITIONAL STANDARDS FOR FOODS PROVIDED ON SCHOOL MEALS
Meals served through the Academy of Educational Excellence National School Lunch and Breakfast Programs will:
• Be appealing and attractive to children
• Be served in clean and pleasant surroundings
• Meet, at a minimum, nutrition requirements established by local, state, and federal statutes and regulations
• Offer a variety of fruits and vegetables
• Serve reduced-fat (2%), low-fat (1%) and fat-free milk and nutritionally-equivalent non-dairy alternatives(to be defined by USDA)
• Ensure that half of the served grains are whole grain (Appendix A)
The Academy of Educational Excellence will engage students and parents, through taste-tests of new entrees and surveys, in selecting foods sold through the school meal programs in order to identify new, healthful, and appealing food choices.
In addition, AEE will share information about the nutritional content of meals with parents and students. Such information could be made available on menus, a website, on cafeteria menu boards, placards, or other point-of-purchase materials.
FOODS OF MINIMAL NUTRITIONAL VALUE (FMNV)
 AEE may not serve or provide access for students to FMNV and all other forms of candy at any time anywhere on school premises until the end of the last scheduled class.
BREAKFAST 
To ensure that all children have breakfast, either at home or at school, in order to meet their nutritional needs and enhance their ability to learn:
• AEE will arrange bus schedules and utilize methods to serve school breakfasts that promote participation, including serving breakfast in the classroom, “grab-and-go” breakfast, or breakfast during morning break or recess.
• AEE will serve breakfast to students and will notify parents and students of the availability of the School Breakfast Program.
• AEE will encourage parents to provide a healthy breakfast for their children through newsletter articles, take-home materials, or other means.

Module 3
PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND ACTIVITY DAILY PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND ACTIVITY
 Elementary Students in AEE including those with disabilities, special healthcare needs and alternative educational settings will receive 
150 minutes of physical activity per week.
 A minimum of 60 minutes of that time will be spent on physical education instruction.
Physical Education Instruction 
All physical education will be taught by certified physical education teachers that are hired by AEE, and the curriculum will be aligned with state/national standards for physical education and dance.
Student involvement in other activities involving physical activity (e.g., interscholastic, intramurals, marching band) will not be substituted for meeting the physical education requirement.
The teacher/student ratio in physical education classes will be consistent with that of other core content areas.
Class space and size in physical education will be suitable for safe and appropriate instruction.
RECESS
AEE will provide at least 15 minutes per day of supervised recess, preferably outdoors, during which moderate to vigorous physical activity is encouraged.
This time will be included in the over all 150 minutes of activity per week. If at all possible, it is recommended that students have recess prior to lunch. 
This can be done in the classroom. AEE should discourage extended periods (i.e. period of two or more hours) of inactivity. When activities, such as mandatory school-wide testing, make it necessary for students to remain indoors for long periods of time, AEE should give students periodic breaks during which they are encouraged to stand and be moderately active.
PHYSICAL ACTIVITY OPPORTUNITIES BEFORE AND AFTER SCHOOL
AEE will offer extracurricular physical activity programs, such as physical activity clubs or intramural programs.
AEE will offer a range of activities that meet the needs, interest, and abilities of all students, including boys, girls, students with disabilities, and students with special health-care needs.

Children who compromise the safety of themselves and others will be removed from that class period.
USE OF SCHOOL FACILITIES OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL HOURS
To the extent possible, school spaces and facilities should be available to students, staff, and community members before and after the school day.
These spaces and facilities also should be available to community agencies and organizations offering physical activity and nutrition programs.
School policies concerning safety and use of equipment will apply at all times.
Module 4
OTHER SCHOOL-BASED ACTIVITIES DESIGNED TO PROMOTE STUDENT AND STAFF WELLNESS
The policies established under this category create a school environment that provide consistent wellness messages and includes goals for other school-based activities that are designed to promote student and staff wellness.
COORDINATED SCHOOL HEALTH APPROACH
:
A model to guide school decision-making related to physical activity and nutrition that encompasses all aspects of the school from education to staff wellness. The coordinated school health program model involves and coordinates the efforts of eight interactive components to maintain well-being. These components are:
 (1) health education, 
 (2) physical education,
(3) health services, 
(4) nutrition services,
(5) counseling, psychological and social services,
(6) health school environment,
(7) health promotion for staff, and
(8) family and community involvement.
The model utilizes community partnerships and school resources to coordinate services, encourage collaboration, and avoid duplication of services. The individual school health advisory councils and AEE school health advisory board are the vehicles through which AEE will coordinate the efforts of these components.
School Health Advisory Councils
AEE will create school health advisory councils to develop, implement, monitor, review, and revise when necessary school nutrition and physical activity policies. 
School health advisory councils consists of groups of individuals representing the AEE and the community and should include parents, students, administrators, teachers, food service personnel, school nurses, and other community members.
AEE will create a district school health advisory board to monitor individual school health advisory councils, create policies, and define and interpret AEE policies regarding school nutrition and physical activity. 
AEE health advisory board consists of school board members, the health services director, food services director, teachers, school nurses, physicians, and community health agency representatives, and parents.
Community/Family Involvement
AEE will support parents' efforts to provide a healthy diet and daily physical activity for their children. 
AEE/school will offer healthy eating information to parents, post nutrition tips on school websites, and provide nutrient analyses of school menus. 
AEE should encourage parents to pack healthy lunches and snacks and to refrain from including beverages and foods that do not meet nutrition standards.
AEE/school will provide parents a list of foods that meet AEE's snack standards and ideas for healthy celebrations/parties, rewards, and fundraising activities.
AEE/school will provide information about physical education and other school based physical activity opportunities before, during, and after the school day; and support parents' efforts to provide their children with opportunities to be physically active outside of school. Such supports will include sharing information about physical activity and physical education through a website, newsletter, or other take-home materials. 
STAFF WELLNESS 
AEE highly values the health and well-being of every staff member and will plan and implement activities and policies that support personal efforts by staff to maintain a healthy lifestyle.
AEE will establish and maintain a staff wellness committee. (The staff wellness committee could be a subcommittee of the school health advisory council.) The committee should develop, promote, and oversee a multifaceted plan to promote staff health and wellness. The plan should be based on input solicited from school staff and should outline ways to encourage healthy eating, physical activity, and other elements of a healthy lifestyle among school staff. The staff wellness committee should distribute its plan to the school health advisory council annually. 
A staff wellness plan could include the components listed below. AEE should not be expected to implement all these elements at once. Starting with just a few of the elements listed below can provide the foundation for evolution to a more comprehensive program.
• Educational activities for school staff members on healthy lifestyle behaviors, eating, physical activity, and injury prevention. 
• Application of nutritional standards for foods and beverages in vending machines available to staff members. 
• Policies to prohibit all tobacco use on school grounds by students, staff members, and school visitors. 
• Establishment of peer support groups for weight management, stress management, tobacco-use cessation, family guidance, and other identified issues. 
• Time during the school day, such as “release time,” during which teachers and other staff members can participate in health-promoting activities. 
• Administration of flu shots at school. 
• Periodic screening at school for blood pressure, blood cholesterol, body mass index, and other health indicators. 
• Encouragement of staff members to set medical appointments for screening for cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and other diseases. • Linkages to established Employee Assistance Programs.
• An ongoing assessment process to update and improve the effectiveness of the staff wellness plan.
SERVICES FOR NUTRITION-RELATED HEALTH PROBLEMS
AEE School Counselors and school health services staff shall consistently promote healthy eating to students and other staff. These professionals shall be prepared to recognize conditions such as obesity, eating disorders, and other nutrition-related health problems among students and staff and be able to refer them to appropriate services.
INDIVIDUAL SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT PLANS AND INCLUSION OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY 
AND NUTRITION-RELATED COMPONENTS FOR STAFF AND STUDENT WELLNESS
AEE Wellness Policy recommendations will be incorporated into each individual school’s overall school improvement plan.
Module 5
MONITORING THE AEE WELLNESS POLICY RESPONSIBILITIES FOR MENTORING AND IMPLEMENTATION
Under the direction of the AEE Governing Board, the superintendent and School Leader will ensure that the directives of AEE’s wellness policy are fulfilled.

An assessment of each school’s compliance with the categories that are outlined in the wellness policy.
Compliance will be based on fulfilling a continuous quality improvement plan that outlines one year and three-year goals as well as action plans that have been drafted to achieve them.
Outcome measures for success will be based on:
Documented observations Student interviews and focus groups Surveys and questionnaires within the school.
DISTRICT HEALTH ADVISORY COUNCIL
• A revised continuous improvement plan will be drafted by the AEE District School Health Advisory Council and submitted for the Governing Board’s approval annually.
• Every three years, a formal reassessment of the wellness policy will be undertaken.
• AEE Health Advisory Council will publish a summary report on AEE’s progress toward its school wellness policy,
• Hold open discussions about the direction of health and wellness in AEE, and submit a new draft wellness policy for the Board’s review.
