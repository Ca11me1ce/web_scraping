Attention--New Release Time!
Due to an unusual weather year with early releases, late starts,
and
 no school, PHS is going to be short 60 minutes of the
required DPI High School hours by June 4. 
In order to make up that 60 minutes, we will begin to make up
that time starting Monday, April 23 -
2 minutes a day for the next 30 days.  
We will release our students at 
3:17 p.m.
 each day vs. 
3:15 p.m.
Thank you for your understanding.

PHS Criteria for Success
PHS goals College and Career Readiness Indicators
When a student graduates from PHS, we feel confident the graduate is college ready, if the student has met the academic indicator of a minimum 2.8 GPA
on a 4.0 scale and has met one or more of the following indicators...
Taken AP courses and earned an A-C and took the corresponding AP Exam earning
	a 3 or higher
Earned an A-C in a Dual Credit Course
Taken a math course their senior year
Completed at least Algebra 2 by the time the student graduates
Scored the following minimums on the ACT
	- English (18); Reading (22); Science (23); Math (22)
When a student graduates from PHS, we feel confident the graduate is career ready,
if the student has identified a Career Cluster and has two or more of the following indicators...
90% Attendance
25 hours of community service
Had a workplace learning experience
Received an Industry Credential
Took a Dual Credit - career pathway courses
Involved in two (2) or more co-curricular activities
Below is our baseline data from the Class of 2017. This is the first time we have collected this researched-based College and Career Readiness Indicator information and will focus each year on improving various areas for growth with each senior class.
This year our goal is to 
increase the Workplace Experiences our students have through Youth Apprenticeship, Work Release, visits to various companies through GuideEd and a Mini Business World day. Additionally, we'll invite speakers in from various lines of work to expose our students to life beyond high school and the expectations of the workplace.
We'd love to include some of our parents to come talk about their workplace experiences and career choices. Contact Mrs. Kvalo if you are interested in being part of a panel this spring. Next year, we plan to have a Career Day, bringing in a large variety of career speakers for all of our students choose from. This is another opportunity for our parents and community to join in this effort to increase Workplace Experiences.

Wall of Honor
Attention PHS "Veteran" Grads:
In case you haven't seen it...we have a beautiful Wall of Honor in the commons at PHS. One part of the Wall of Honor recognizes graduates of the current PHS building 1998 to present, who have served or are serving in the Armed Forces. Additionally we have added a large plaque to recognize all our PHS Veterans, service men and women, who graduated from Portage High School prior to this building opening in 1998. If you are one of those PHS veteran graduates, please 
email P
rincipal
 Kvalo
, with your full name, date of graduation and branch of service.
Spread the word. 
We add to the current plaque as we get five or more new names.
