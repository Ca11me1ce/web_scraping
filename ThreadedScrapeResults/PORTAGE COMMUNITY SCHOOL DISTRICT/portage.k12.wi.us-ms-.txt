College Days for Kids
On Friday, April 27th, twenty 6th graders attended College Days For Kids today at UW Steven's Point. They enjoyed a variety of classes including; Astronomy, Sign Language, Pens and Poetry, Origami, Taekwondo, Chemistry Magic, Backpacking... A great time was had by all!
STEM Presentation
Ms. Maratik's science classes had the STEM presentation with Progressive in late April.  The presenters walked them through a CSI of a car accident.  In trying to figure out what had happened and who was at fault, students used multiple STEM concepts to find distance, speed, and reaction time.  Also, while the presenters were with us, they gave us additional information about the different jobs that were needed in able to solve this accident (from police to a claims adjuster, they even talked about marketing, accounting, etc needed within the Progressive business).  At the end of the day, it came down to someone texting while driving vs someone not yielding to the person with the right of way, and both shared fault in the accident.  Overall, lots of concepts were used and learned, and students had a fun interaction with STEM concepts and learning about various jobs they might not otherwise known about.
Special Guests from PHS
Portage High School FBLA members and officers Emma Shortreed, Annika Hentz, and Hannah Ness stopped by Miss Layman's 6th grade Language Arts classes to discuss public speaking skills and their experiences in FBLA in preparation for the 6th grade How-To speeches next week! The students were able to practice in front of Emma, Hannah, and Annika and receive some valuable feedback!
HOSA
