Volunteer Opportunities
Thank you for your interest in volunteering with the Portage Community School District. We value our volunteers and understand that partnership with volunteers is one of the major assets of our school district.
Per the Board of Education policy listed below, all individuals who wish to volunteer in the district must complete a criminal background check prior to volunteering. Portage Community School District contracts The Background Investigation Bureau to perform these checks.
If you wish to volunteer or serve as a chaperone, please complete the online application below.
Information to know before completing the
online Volunteer application form:
The criminal background check process can take up to 
5 business days to complete. Last minute applications for either classroom activities or field trips are not likely to be processed in time.
Your volunteer application, once approved, is valid for one year. You will need to complete a new application to begin volunteering each year. 
If you are unsure if you had a criminal background check processed or are unsure if your background check has expired, please contact the office at the school where you plan to volunteer.
If your volunteer application is NOT approved, you will be notified by the Background Investigation Bureau.
Step 1.  Please read the Volunteer Policy
Step 2. Complete the Online Background Check Form
Step 3. Complete the Emergency Volunteer form
Please bring the completed form to the school office the first day you will be volunteering.
