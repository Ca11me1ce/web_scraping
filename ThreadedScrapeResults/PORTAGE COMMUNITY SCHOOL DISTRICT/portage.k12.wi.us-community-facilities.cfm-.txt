How to Request District Facilities.
    Many of the District's facilities are authorized by District administration for use by school, community, public and civic groups.  These facilities include indoor and outdoor sports       facilities, conference rooms, labs, and auditorium.  Use must meet established facility use criteria, and may not conflict with regularly scheduled programs of the school or facility.
    To request space at one of the District facilities, please use the on-line Facility Use Scheduling System located below.
    First time users of the system:  Register yourself or organization as a Facilities Requester.  Go to the Facility Use Scheduling System and click on "Requester" at the top of the page.  Complete and submit the form.  Once approved, you will receive an email message with a login and password (feel free to change your password after your initial log in).
    Returning users:  Go to the Facility Use Scheduling System.  Enter the system using your log in and password.  Check the "Public Calendar" for available times and locations.  Click on "Requester."  Click on "New Request" on the left side of the screen.  Complete required information and submit for approval.
