May 17 Retirement Open House
HOMEPAGE In The News
May 17 Retirement Open House
May 17 Retirement Open House
April 25, 2018
After many years of guiding Mariners with their unique wit and wisdom, language arts teacher Phil Bailey and math teacher Debbie Cain will be leaving Magellan to retire at the end of this school year. We want to help them celebrate their time at
Magellan, and send them off with best wishes for the future.
Please join us on Thursday, May 17, for a retirement open house for both Mr. Bailey and Mrs. Cain. We will gather from 7 to 8:30 p.m. at the Greystone Baptist Church at 7509 Lead Mine Road . This is a wonderful opportunity to share your memories with Mr. Bailey and Mrs. Cain, as well as connect with current and past Magellan families. We would love to see you there!
