Come Paint With Us!
April 16, 2018
It is time for all hands on deck! Five years have passed since Magellan’s classrooms have been painted, and the walls are starting to show the wear and tear of daily use. We can save the school tens of thousands of dollars by having volunteers give all the rooms a fresh coat of paint.
Please help us make Magellan look great by giving your time to this important project.
Throughout June, we have scheduled:
Three days to prep rooms and walls — Saturday 6/9, Wednesday 6/13, and
Thursday 6/14
 Four days to paint all of the classrooms — Saturday 6/16, Wednesday 6/20,
Thursday 6/21, and Saturday 6/23
One clean-up day — Wednesday 6/27
 One final day to paint the hallways and stairwells— Saturday 6/30
Even if you can’t paint, we could use your help moving furniture, spackling and sanding.
We need lots of helping hands, so please join us for as many days as you can.
