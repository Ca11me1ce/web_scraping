Special Programs at Magellan Charter School offers the least restrictive environment for all children identified.
Research has shown evidence that students with exceptional needs whose educational needs can be met in a regular classroom setting benefit by remaining in that setting.
A certified special education teacher often co-teaches in classrooms to provide an even smaller student/teacher ratio and provide special education consultative services when needed. These special educators assist the classroom teacher in making necessary modifications and adjusting the presentation of curriculum as needed so students can be successful.
Students’ individualized educational plans are followed and updated annually. Psychological evaluations, re-evaluations, and educational testing are conducted as required by state mandates or as requested by parents.
