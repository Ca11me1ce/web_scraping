artners for Education – MaP
Magellan teachers, administration and parents enjoy collaborating through Magellan Partners for Education, also called MaP, to help make the Magellan experience great for everyone!
MaP was created as a partnership between parents and staff to help promote excellence in programs, facilities and an atmosphere for education. You can look over the 
MaP bylaws here.
Whether organizing the next middle school dance, coordinating  student and family participation in community service events, or organizing luncheons to show our teachers how much we appreciate them, MaP is focusing on serving the school’s  educational, social and financial activities.

All families are encouraged to join MaP, and attend meetings held each month to keep information flowing between parents and the school. MaP meetings are a great way to learn about upcoming volunteer opportunities, understand how MaP finances are being used to support Magellan programs, and hear from members of the board and the administration. Please join us to see what is happening at the school! Or check out the 
minutes from recent meetings here. 
Even if you can’t attend the monthly meetings, MaP compiles information each week to send to families. The Magellan Minute offers brief descriptions and links to more details about what is going on at school. You can find the latest 
Minute here

Lunches
Another way MaP supports the Magellan community is by paying for the 
OrgsOnline
 service used to pre-order Chick-fil-A and Salsa Fresh lunches. Served on Mondays, Chick-fil-A meals are a fundraiser for the Magellan Boosters and our sports teams. The Salsa Fresh meals on Fridays are offered at cost to our families.
Every few months, families can use OrgsOnline to order and pay for food to be delivered for their students. New families can set up an account 
using these instructions
.
 Payments can be made using an electronic check (the preferred, fee-free option), a credit card or a debit card. Please be aware that the only way to pay for Chick-fil-A and Salsa Fresh meals is through OrgsOnline.
