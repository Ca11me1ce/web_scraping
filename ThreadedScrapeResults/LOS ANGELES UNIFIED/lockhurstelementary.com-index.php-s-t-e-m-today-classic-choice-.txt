Classic stays Constant
Parents are always asking me if they should buy a device for home and what kind of device is best for their kids.
The choices are almost unbearable. It is a Vegas Buffet with non-stop choices for every palate. You can easily get tempted to over indulge, and if succumb to gluttony you will suffer miserably. I am describing my choices to buy computational device for work and play.
The biggest error some make is buying a device the child is using at school. School administrator have made a decision to use a device at school with a different set of criteria and yours. Their budget is always strained, unlike yours that can take advantage of sales, slightly older models, open boxe specials and more. Very rarely a computer used at school, may also fit your home needs perfectly.
I discourage parents from sharing their personal computer with their kids. I have seen too many kids accidentally downloading a virus and other junk on the machine. There are some things that should be considered "off limits" for kids and Mom/ Dad's computer should be one of them. So, parents buy your kids their own computer.
What shall we buy? Let's not beat around the bush. Buy your child a computer or laptop and not the hundred million choice of devices out there that are "trendy", but lack the classic needs.
I advise to buy a computer/laptop for these reasons:
has a mouse and keyboard making is easy for young students to use the device easily. For example: Art programs, Spreadsheets etc. are very cumbersome to use without a mouse.
open software available for PC's make the this device attractive. There are many free programs that are wonderful to use. My favorite being TUX paint and others.
No fussy problems to use flash websites. Flash is used on many educational game websites that host excellent math, science & english language games.
Cost are comparable to all the devices out there.
To write code, students need a computer. To code in Python, C++, Javascript and HTML etc. you need a computer. Swift Playgrounds is the only iPad app available to teach coding for iOS.
Computer last 3-5 years, it can be upgraded (PC's more than Macs)
