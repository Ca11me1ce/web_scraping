Your school's technology expenses are fixed, and there are no "surprises" or hidden costs in the middle of the school year. For schools that already have a computer lab, CWK offers a basic instruction package and additional services like technicians and network administrators.

We can help and guide you make those important decisions for the long term. We are the experts in the field of education technology. We know the current and future trends happening in technology. We understand the needs and requirements for the student and teachers in a computer lab. We can build the school the right computer lab in no time.

Schools without a Lab (50-200 Students)
MOBILE LAPTOP CLASSROOM: This is ideal for a small school with limited resources of capital, space and man power. We provide a mobile computer lab option. Our Instructor will setup a LAPTOP computer lab for the day at your school. We provide 15 laptops (mouse/mouse pad) and a projector to run the classroom. Setup and dismantle takes minutes only; and the room can be used for music, drama or any other discipline the next day. The students benefit from a winning computer curriculum and reliable computers every class. The school benefits from an INSTANT computer lab without any capital expenses for hardware or software, maintenance headaches, breakdown issues and curriculum planning.
