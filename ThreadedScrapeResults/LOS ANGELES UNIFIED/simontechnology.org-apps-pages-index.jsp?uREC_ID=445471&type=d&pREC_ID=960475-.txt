Mission Statement
The mission of Cindy and Bill Simon Technology Academy High School is to create 21st century learners through individualized student-centered instruction that makes academics both personal and relevant for every student.  To do this, we will use the Alliance hybrid learning model that incorporates a blended curriculum, multimedia instruction, and digital content. Moreover, our students will have solid character and strong critical thinking/collaborative skills.  These skills will create socially responsible and globally minded citizens that are an integral part of the Watts community and beyond.
