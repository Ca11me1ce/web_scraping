Our summer camp programs are not taught during the year in your school. As technology gains importance in our everyday lives, it is important for kids to learn meaningful and fun programming languages like: Robotics, Minecraft, Game Design Scratch programming. Besides the programming we will be teaching Photo editing and 3D drawing too. S.T.E.M learning during summer time!
More than just computers Our camp is designed to be fun. We combine a healthy balance of indoor and outdoor activities. The other activities your child will participate in are: sports, arts, crafts and science. We have a special activity planned for each day of the week.

What are the start and end times for Camp ?

Tell me about Before & After Care? (varies by location)
Before care starts at 8 a.m. and after care is from 3:00-5:00 p.m. The students will participate in outdoor and indoor activities during this time.
Why is camp 1 week long?
Computerwisekids has made a promise to provide a quality program. In order to make our summer program meaningful, we have chosen to offer 1 week long courses. This allows the student to learn the subject well. Each child learns at his/her own pace. Students will leave camp with a completed project to share with their parents.
Will my child learn the same course material again if I sign up for 2 weeks for the same course?
No, your child would start on a new project and continue to sharpen his/her skills. It is a very good idea to reinforce the things they have learned. All the Camps have Levels ranging from 1-3.
Do I need to buy a subscription for Minecraft?
No, you do not need to buy a subscription for Minecraft during the camp. We use a Minecraft EDU version. Students sign-in on a server set up for the camp.

Campers should carry their own snack & sack lunch to camp. Please make us aware of any food allergies your child may have. The camp is NOT a peanut free campus.

During the year, they deliver the Computerwisekids Curriculum at Elementary School computer labs in various Public and Private schools in LA.
