Cuauhuihuiyohqueh Xinaxtemaxtiloyan Yaotlamachilistle - Danza Azteca
Semillas has continued to expand its development of Indigenous education, especially education through its Knowledge in Nahuatl design. Supported by both a grant from the Seventh Generation Fund for Indigenous Peoples and a multi-year partnership with the California Department of Education, Semillas has recruited, trained and advanced three Indigenous Nahuatl speaking credentialed teachers from the State of Morelos, Mexico. In the summer of 2012, Semillas partnered with the Secretary of Education of Mexico the Educacion Intercultural to sponsor a four day summit on Knowledge in Nahuatl.
A fellowship cultivating Native youth leadership for global advocacy
By counsel of the Consejo de Danza Azteca of Anahuacalmecac- Xinaxcalmecac, select students participate in an intensive cultural knowledge cultivation experience centered around Danza Azteca, Nahuatl literacy and Aztec diplomacy. From the unique perspective as Indigenous Peoples, our students study Native and international teachings of statesmanship, leadership and fellowship. The Cuauhuihuiyohqueh meet weekly for an intense five hour session that begins with academic tutoring, focuses in on a study of Indigenous diplomacy and concludes with Danza Azteca training. The instructors include Semillas’ Executive Director Tlayecantzi Marcos Aguilar, Consejo de Danza member and parent volunteer, Maria Villamil and guest lecturer Marcella Macias of Angel's Flight Runaway & Homeless Youth Services. The curriculum consists of an organic course of study called Petlamachilistle in Nahuatl, or “the way of diplomacy” and the United Nations Association-USA’s Global Classroom curriculum.
CUAUHUIHUIYOHQUEH develop leadership through Semillas' founding principles and become the schools' student body governing entity. While students are expected to establish above average academic performance, not all students who enter the Cuauhuihuiyohqueh begin there. Some students are recruited as a result of difficulties they have faced in school and are working to overcome. The most important factor in the nomination, selection and participation of maxtihque (students) for this fellowship, is their will to demonstrate leadership based upon the ancestral cultural teachings. Potential for leadership is valued as a path to engage students at risk of poor performance in school. Nevertheless, Cuauhuihuiyohqueh also includes the most dedicated and high achieving students.
The Cuauhuihuiyohqueh have participated in several major experiences over the years: from the Model United Nations Conference (visit the website: 
Model United Nations
) held on the campus of the University of Southern California on June 5, 2009 in Los Angeles California and the Hanban Chinese Bridge Summer Camp for High School Students (visit the website: 
HanBan
) sponsored by the University of California, Los Angeles in China to the recent Native Nations Rise March in Washington D.C. Our student delegates in both events prepared to represent our schools and community at an international level both locally and globally.
The Cuauhuihuiyohqueh are being cultivated to become a voice for Indigenous youth in Los Angeles, and Indigenous Peoples at a continental level. As an sponsored project of the Seventh Generation Fund for Indian Development (visit the website: 
http://www.7genfund.org/
 ), the Cuauhuihuiyohqueh can draw upon the leadership of elders with decades of experience in the international arena. The Seventh Generation Fund has been actively defending the rights of Indigenous Peoples and sowing the seeds of Indigenous Nations for decades. To affiliate with the Seventh Generation Fund is a tremendous honor for Semillas and our students. Founded in 1977, the Seventh Generation Fund for Indian Development emerged from a call made by Indigenous communities in the Americas during the cultural, social and political renaissance era of the 1960’s and 1970’s. Today, the mission of the Seventh Generation Fund remains as its founders originally envisioned: dedicated to promoting and maintaining the uniqueness of Native peoples and the sovereignty of tribal Nations. The Cuauhuihuiyohqueh Fellowship will grow from the examples and foundation set by the elders and leadership of the Seventh Generation Fund to one day participate in the United Nations representing the youth of Anahuac and of the world.
