Welcome
At Camino Nuevo, we work to build a college-going culture from Day One. From preschool through high school, our students visit colleges and universities, experiences that open their eyes to the universe of possibilities and often influence what colleges they apply to as seniors. Last spring, our second graders took their first trip to UCLA and our older students visited colleges in northern California and on the East Coast. Throughout this journey, our students are challenged academically and build the habits and skills to succeed in college. 
Now in our 17th year, our work to prepare students for college continues to pay off. This fall, 98 percent of our graduates from the Class of 2017 are starting college. Our graduates were accepted to 19 California State University campuses, 9 University of California schools, and over 60 private colleges and universities across the country!  Tufts University, Smith College, Connecticut College, Syracuse University, UC Berkeley, USC and UCLA are among the highlights. 
Thank you for supporting our mission to continue to put more students on the path to and through college.
