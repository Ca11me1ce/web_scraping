				Threat against school a hoax according to LAPD			
						A school threat received by school administration turned out to be a hoax.					
Today at approximately 11:45 Anahuacalmecac International University Preparatory of North America school administration discovered an anonymous emailed threat to the school and the students at Anahuacalmecac International University Preparatory of North America. 
The school initiated a lockdown and contacted LAPD for emergency response. LAPD and AIUP administrators initiated evacuation protocols. Authorities later determined that similar threats had been made across the country and declared the threat a hoax. Students were returned to campus and parents were notified to pick up students as soon as possible. 
All classes will return to session as normal tomorrow. Parents are asked to advise school personnel if any students express signs of stress at home regarding this experience. Hoaxes such as these are costly and impactful upon students already traumatized by real-world issues. Anahuacalmecac will continue to work towards school safety and community wellness in the face of these and other threats against our communities and children everywhere.
