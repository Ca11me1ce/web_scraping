.  As an independent, nonprofit, public charter school, 100% of state and federal education funds come directly to our school.  As a school within the Alliance College-Ready Public Schools network, we have a contract with Alliance to provide our school with operational, financial, technology and human resources functions so that our school leaders and educators can dedicated the majority of their time to the education of our scholars. The fee for the Alliance services is 10% of our budget. With 90% of funds remaining at the discretion of our local school board, our school is afforded greater flexibility and control of our resources, in comparison to traditional public schools where school-based budgets are set at the district level.
