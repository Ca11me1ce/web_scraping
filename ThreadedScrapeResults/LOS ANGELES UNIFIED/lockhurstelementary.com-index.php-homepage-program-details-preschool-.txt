About the Preschool Program
Over the past decade, personal computers and the Internet have become a part of our lives. Computerwisekids has conducted extensive research of learning method, web technologies and software design to create a practical, fun and educative approach to introduce kids to computers. Our workshops are specifically designed for children ages 3 1/2 - 6 years. Kids learn the basic needed to use a computer. We start with eye hand coordination. Learning about the mouse, the mouse controls; click, double click and the drag and click method. We use proprietary Computerwisekids educational software to teach and familiarize children with the keyboard and components of the computer. The computer is used as a medium for art, craft and writing. Class projects involve art, craft and movie making too! This class stretches the kid's creativity, problem solving and graphical skills. In addition there is online access from home to reinforce and share the work done in class.
