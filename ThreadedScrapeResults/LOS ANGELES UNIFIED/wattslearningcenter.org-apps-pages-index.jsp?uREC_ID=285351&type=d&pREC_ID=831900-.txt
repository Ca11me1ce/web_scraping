Core Experiences
What are the core experiences that a Watts Learning Center graduate has acquired as a basis for subsequent learning?
This question is a part of the ongoing dialogue in our schools as our teaching teams develop, revise and create meaningful curricular materials and learning progressions for our students.
Passport to the World
Passport to the World is an education travel program started by Watts Learning Center that takes a small group of fourth and fifth graders--with parent chaperones--on an international trip every two years. The program's goal is to expose students to a world outside of South L.A., provide them with an educational and cultural learning experience, and to develop "global learners." Since the first trip in 2002 to South Africa, WLC students have visited Ghana, Togo and Benin, Senegal and Gambia, Egypt, Costa Rica. In 2015, our children and families will experience Brazil.
Canyon Creek
As a transition year bridging our elementary and middle schools, our 5th and 6th grade students learn and grow together from the Canyon Creek weekend sports camp experience.
