						A special film highlighting Semillas Community Schools produced by the IB's Global Centre in the Hague, Switzerland, has been released for use in teacher professional development throughout the world. An IB commissioned film crew spent a day filming our schools in December, 2011, to document and produce a short video that highlighted our international curriculum, indigenous education and multilingual programs. The IB Global Centre in The Hague, Netherlands, contacted Marcos Aguilar requesting collaboration from Semillas on this important project. The IB Global Centre supports multilingualism and intercultural understanding across all programmes in the IB Continuum. Semillas was chosen as the only Los Angeles area IB World School to be featured in a professionally-produced short film that introduces the IB's soon-to-be-published statement on education in global contexts. The film crew focused on three classrooms depicting our educational continuum in PYP and MYP. Multilingual education and indigenous education in the global context were the focus of all of the filming and interviews.​﻿﻿Many thanks to our staff, students and all our parents who supported this valuable project. Thanks also to Rocco Shields of Wingspan Pictures for such an outstanding job of capturing the Semillas spirit on film. The film will be available for viewing for a limited time only for our network of supporters.

tunnel  education is culture there is no absence of culture and education question is whose culture are you learning in our highly interconnected world understanding language is final for engaging with local and Global challenges schools and communities are shaped by many internal and external reality but every learning engagement swims in a sea of words images and multilingual semantic webs when we can learn about cultural learning about language nnn language is just another word for knowledge Cherry that philosophy of who we need to be in the world meaning how to be responsible people

able to preserve culture and Anna Beacon of Hope and community that is in great despair throughout the day learning takes place in three languages Spanish their mother tongue English and Noah and Indigenous language of the southwestern States and Central Mexico  excellent if you think about it in the whole United States there's only one school that is teaching now and it is going back to mother tongue that is was backing into our history as one of our first languages and then having Spanish as there's another one of her mother think so both languages here they feel that sense of proudness because it even go deeper Aztec this is your mother tongue and I think for anyone to be able to connect with that it just supports you even more so being a well-rounded human being and as

token lucky Motika can I keep the 180 chanti like I'm fat Ocala Family Medical hit that one um Yambo Kenosha Campanile at Academy leessang translate Batman languages Consciousness in languages is a vehicle for approaching others what do you learn in Africa  so it's very interesting to find that where in common ground with the IB on an international level and and it's positive because what what the IB is now recognizing as a part of its new multilingual is to value of the assets that we have is people as human beings in our capacity to be able to have different kinds of languages and in our capacity to be able to languages  repeat this one with a different areas of your brain and I we have research that shows that students that in this sit 7th grade A score higher that any other students uniforms around the school so we see that our language program helps saying in their development as that's the intellectuals stop in and out the school through the fourth kid dancing to One P&P incest up and then what does an education is culturally entrenched to a cultural education to a sense of identity and a lot of times when we have indigenous people in the city that's already one sense of extraction from from from the roots or from the cultural traditions and so a sense of learning the language all over again a sense of freak really helps the children because we can learn about our culture and and she's had to be really open-minded player sales near communities that the whole world students at sameer's Value the multiple perspectives they develop from thinking in more than one

construct meaning and make sense of the world teachers and students grapple with global Concepts through a dynamic educational experience framed by inquiry action and reflection what is it to have the second string in your house without connecting and so the students when they are faced with that question then I swear it starting to delve into the actual art mediums and the topics and how it it then deletes throughout the world then they're able to start building some sort of research in there and their foundation for what they're about to do chosen have more than one meaning to write so when we engaged in even seeing the correlations between all the pieces then it starts to help them to think that it has more then just a piece of art and Soul by producing something that's in creep I send it just dumb it puts the whole put the foundation and puts a significance to representations are important because everybody can understand them although everyone has a different opinion of whatever you represent everybody has an iOS similar idea of what the actual meaning is I think IB Educators have a particular responsibility because they're conscious of the international nature our existence as human beings we're not just standard Public School teachers we're not just standard teachers we're taking on a responsibility to help to help improve The Human Condition on this Earth our students are learning to collaborate to work together to understand and and work with differences and that's very valuable to us that's that's indigenous to us and that something that we want to

ANAHUACALMECAC ASEGURA SEGURIDAD DE ALUMNOS - 10.13.2016											
Featured										
12 de octubre del 2016 - El 3 de octubre del 2016 a las 11:30 de la noche y de nuevo ayer 13 de octubre 2016, el plantel 4990 Huntington Drive K-2  de Anahuacalmecac  fue invadido y destrozado. El agresor rompió una ventana de vidrio de una altura de diez pies para entrar en las instalaciones de la escuela después de haber escalado un muro de diez pies de altura. El sospechoso es un hombre que se ha acercado en varias ocasiones al personal escolar pidiendo "llevarse a sus hijos", a quien supuestamente y falsamente cree que están en nuestra escuela. El sospechoso aparentemente es bien conocido por los agentes del LAPD por una historia larga de comportamientos preocupantes y una erupción de robos en los alrededores de la comunidad. En consideracion de las preocupaciones bien documentados y pruebas recopiladas, LAPD detuvo al sospechoso ayer, 13 de octubre 2016. Gracias a Anahuacalmecac los alumnos de nuevo regresaran a un plantel seguro.
