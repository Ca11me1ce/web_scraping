IndigeNations Scholars - 11th & 12th Grades
IndigeNations Scholars
 - Indigenous Inquiry, Cultivation Curriculum, Transformative Teaching, Collective Consciousness
For students in grades 11 and 12, Anahuacalmecac offers a college preparatory, culturally immersive experience and curriculum called 
IndigeNations Scholars
.
Preceded by the IB’s Primary Years Programme (PYP) and Middle Years Program (MYP). The three programs are philosophically aligned, each center on developing attributes of the 
IB learner profile
. The programs are consistent in their pedagogical approach. However, Anahuacalmecac's final two years of instruction depart from the IB's program model and dive into a focus on decolonizing their study of international education through language, culturally rooted pedagogy and critical reflection.
MAIZE–The educational design of Semillas Community Schools
The praxis of Metacognitive Ancestry-based Indigenous Zetetic Eduction
Since 2002, Semillas Community Schools has engaged in the practice of decolonizing, regenerative education. In 2015, Semillas consolidated the thirteen-year practice of autonomous decolonizing education into a coherent pedagogy, epistemology, methodologies and praxis called Metacognitive Ancestry -based Indigenous Zetetic Eduction (MAIZE). MAIZE educational design is rooted in a principle of sovereign knowledge particular to Indigenous Peoples distinguishing knowledge as a manifestation of both the origins and continuity of knowledge that is both earth and culturally based.
MAIZE educational design aims to decolonize the deculturalizing agency of schooling by grounding Indigenous Peoples schools instead with in a transformative culture of teaching and learning that advances sovereignty and self-determination.
Through metacognitive analysis of what society claims to know and how society deculturalizes learners, teachers and learners transform the process and purpose of education creating instead opportunity for consciousness to align with transformative agency. Within a framework and through a body of ancestry-based knowledge, Indigenous teachers and learners contextualize the metacognitive process within specific global and historical realities constructing relationships of meaning relevant to the educand and community through curriculum. In the process of teaching and learning, indigeneity empowers the practice and experience of remembering, being and regenerating cultural ways of knowing and living within the educational community. Constructing meaning in the face of current global realities and dynamics requires the creative seeking of knowledge, understanding and meaning without the presupposition of certainty. Zetetic eduction places the process of education in continual search for the context and outlines the relation between learners and teachers as one of valued guidance through the shared seeking of meaning and construction of new knowledge. Through MAIZE educational design, Semillas turns principles of humanistic indigenous education rooted in the ancestral kalmekak institutions of central Mexico into a relevant modern practice of college preparatory, life enriching, academically rigorous way of transformative and culturally responsive schooling. Through a process of eductive teaching and learning, Semillas Community Schools aims to decolonize the process of schooling and give rise to the regeneration of positive, meaningful and successful educational communities dedicated to both access to and success in teaching, learning and preparing future generations of indigenous children and youth.
