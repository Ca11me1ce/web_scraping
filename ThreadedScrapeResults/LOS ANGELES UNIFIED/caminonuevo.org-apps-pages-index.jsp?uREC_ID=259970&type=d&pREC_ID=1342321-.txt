School Leadership
Be the Change. Lead at Camino Nuevo.
Champions for College Access
Leaders at Camino Nuevo Charter Academy are champions for college access for all students. From walking with students, families, and community members at the annual La Caminata to creating a college-going culture at their school sites, CNCA leaders are consistently advocating for access to higher education.
Ongoing Professional Development
From summer leadership retreats to role teams to CNCA Leadership Team meetings, leaders participate in ongoing professional development each school year. Camino Nuevo currently partners with The Management Center and the National Equity Project to provide high quality development that is practical and role specific.
Excellence & Joy
Camino Nuevo leaders run dynamic schools with robust programs that get at the heart of what it means to work toward becoming literate, critical thinkers and agents of social change. Leaders embrace a holistic education that promotes both excellence and joy.
