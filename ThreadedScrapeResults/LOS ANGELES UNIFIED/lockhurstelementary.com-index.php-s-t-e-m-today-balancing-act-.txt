Why do we need girls in STEM?
Lately I have observed that there is a lot of buzz on the subject of STEM, and in particular, the need to encourage more girls to pursue STEM careers. I don't see educators and parents rushing out to push nursing school for boys or even fashion or culinary vocations. Every article I read talks about the need for more girls in STEM. Why?
Are boys not good enough?
I'd love to say its, because "girls do a better job!"! Ha! that will result in a bunch of parents all twisted in a knot with fury! No really, why can't we have the unequal equation?.
Does it have to do with the high number of STEM related jobs we need to fill in the future? Is it about gender equality genders? Why is this balance important?
I teach computer education and most of my students who choose to work on coding are not girls. The ratio of boys to girls is 3:1. I have paid no attention to it, just as one pays no heed to the fact that most boys hate playing with dolls and most girls hate playing with cars. So, what's the big push now? Why change it, why can't the girls make the choice on their own?
I was convinced the whole thing is some crazy scheme for someone to make a buck, and I had not really figured out who or what. It turns out, we need women to be more that just part of a focus group. We need them in the designers chair, thinking and creating from their perspective. We need a women's point of view on the blueprint of ideas and design.
Women historically have not been encouraged to pursue science careers and those who have entered the field have experienced some kind of discrimination or setback during college years or work experience. Its time to make that change happen with our educators Let's encourage young women in the field of STEM and show them our support because I'm sure the world is not done witnessing amazing ideas from teams made of men & women.
