Can learning STEM happen through Osmosis?
Osmosis is the process “the process of gradual or unconscious assimilation of ideas, knowledge, etc.” Can learning STEM happen through Osmosis. Yes! At our STEM Minecraft camp that's how learning happens. It is one of a kind learning experience. The assignment for the kids begins with them marooned on a ship far far away in the galaxy. The only way to safety is by repairing the four areas of damaged to of the ship. There will be 4 teams who will compete against each other for resources and ideas to replace and fix the spacecraft to become functional. Teamwork, problem solving, analytical thinking and creativity are a few of the things campers will learn. Chemistry and physics concepts play a big role as campers will need to study blue prints and mechanical systems to bring the ship home safe. There are no Prerequisites to this camp, a beginners knowledge of Minecraft is helpful. SAVE $35 on full day camps with code: sumfun35 Hurry offer ends May 15, 2018
