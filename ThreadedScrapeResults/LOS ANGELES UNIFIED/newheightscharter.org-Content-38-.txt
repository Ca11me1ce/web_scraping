The school asks parents to participate in supporting their children's education by giving time to activties such as: Family Night, Parent-Teacher Conferences, student writing celebrations, etc. The school also considers the time spent out of school in the library, museum, or other cultural institution in the community as a contribution. Although volunteer hours are not mandatory, we ask each family to consider contributing 30 hours and we celebrate their achievement of this goal each year at the school picnic.
