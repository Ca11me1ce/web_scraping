New Heights Charter School Supplemental Education Services Data 
Supplemental Education Services are classes or tutoring which occur outside the regular school day with educational providers approved by the State Board of Education. If the number of eligible students who apply for the SES program exceeds the financial resources available, the lowest achieving students from low-income families will receive SES first. New Heights will be working with the Youth Policy Institute to offer this support to our students. If you are interested in SES, please contact the school office to sign-up. The support will be given afterschool.
