Announcements
May 3, 2018
Dear Higley Families:
We are happy to announce that schools will reopen on Friday, May 4, and will resume a normal schedule, including before and after-school Kids Club care.
Regarding make-up days: Arizona schools are required to meet a prescribed number of instructional minutes per the state statute. Higley will meet the required number of minutes without extending the current school calendar, which ends May 23. There will be no additional schools days for students.
As a reminder, AP testing and graduation ceremonies will continue as scheduled for high schools.
For any concerns or questions, please contact your school principal.
We look forward to seeing students and employees back to school to finish out the 2017-18 school year strong.
Sincerely,
Dr. Mike Thomason
Superintendent

All classes will be held at Higley High School. Students who wish to enroll in any summer school class must have a consultation and signature of a high school counselor. Summer school forms are available in the counselors' offices. Please visit the

E-mail communication
Higley Unified School District has launched an APP as another tool for communication with Higley families. The new system will allow schools to send e-mails, as well as push notifications for those who download the app. 
We are excited to offer this new communication tool to our families and look forward to seeing how it grows over the next few months.
Please note: In order to continue receiving e-mail communication, families must have a current, up-to-date e-mail address on file with their schools. The current Constant Contact system will be phased out before the end of the school year. Families that do not have an updated e-mail with the schools may not receive all the communication being sent.
If you have changed your e-mail in the last few months, created a new e-mail or have not provided an e-mail to your school, please do so as quickly as possible.

ParentVue Reminder
All HUSD families should sign up for a ParentVue account. This allows parents to view student grades and absences, as well as see – when they are posted – class schedules and teacher information. The district also uses ParentVue during class selection times at the middle schools and high schools.
Sign up requires an IN PERSON visit to the school office. If you already have a ParentVue account, and your child is moving from one HUSD school to another, no action is required. The updated information will appear when it is available.
If you have questions, please contact your school's office.

About HUSD
        	Higley Unified School District is a community of schools that share a common commitment to education and achievement for our youth and a sense of well-being for all. We focus on providing continuity from preschool to high school and offer a well-rounded education with academics, music, arts, languages, athletics, physical education, technology, and character education.
Our performance meets and exceeds state standards in academics, and our students are champions both on and off the field. We are tenaciously focused on each student's learning, and we take the guesswork out of education with data-driven instruction and accountability.
