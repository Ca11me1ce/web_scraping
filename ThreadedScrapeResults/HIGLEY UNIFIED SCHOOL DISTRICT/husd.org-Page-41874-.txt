Letter from the Superintendent 3.02.18
Dear Higley Unified School District Families:
The news of the tragedy in Florida two weeks ago impacted parents, teachers and school employees. It has sparked much conversation nationwide and an outpouring of support for the families.
Unfortunately, it has also sparked a number of threats to schools nationwide and fears are understandably running high.
Numerous schools across the country have been impacted by reports of threats and rumors of threats. These threats and rumors of threats impact the schools they stem from or are directed toward. One of Higley Unified School District’s own campuses made local news due to an online threat. This resulted in many hours being devoted to the police investigation, surveillance of and on the campus, and extensive communications between agencies.
While we will continue to be vigilant, take every report seriously, and devote the time necessary to discover the identities of those behind these threats, we also need the community’s help.
Keeping Higley Unified School District’s students, staff and community safe is everyone’s responsibility. False reporting or online rumors spread unnecessary fear and concern. If you see it or hear of a threat, please report it immediately to school administration or law enforcement. Assume you are the only one to hear of it and report it to the proper authorities.
The district also operates a Safe Hotline with both a phone option - (480) 279-7233 - and an e-mail option - 
safe.hotline@husd.org
 - to anonymously report concerns. 
We will continue to take every step possible to ensure student safety on our campuses. This includes taking every action necessary to vet every report, including those that may seem benign. Each step we take will be based on information and facts as they are gathered through the investigative process.
There are school and legal consequences for those who make threats to schools, staff and students. Even the act of repeating or reposting a threat or possible threat may result in that individual facing school, state or federal consequences and legal prosecution.
School threat: The act of stating an intended action whether written, oral or electronic or an action that could cause harm, death, fear or panic. 
School consequences may be up to a 9-day out-of-school suspension or a referral for possible expulsion.
In addition, a school threat can be prosecuted as a Class 1 misdemeanor or a Class 6 felony with fines up to $150,000 and possible jail time.
With this, we are asking parents to assist in a few specific areas:
• First, we are asking all families to take time to talk with their children about both the need to be watchful and mindful of what they see and hear, but also to come to their parents or school leaders should they have a serious concern. If you see it or hear it, don’t repeat it - report it.
• Second, again, we ask all Higley parents and students to be mindful of social media. Please bring any concerns directly to school or law officials. Your administrators are here to support and answer questions. If you have a concern, please contact them directly rather than engaging in online chatter.
Together, we can continue to keep our schools safe and offer the reassurance to students that they are in a watchful environment with adults who care for them dearly.
Sincerely,
Dr. Mike Thomason
Superintendent
