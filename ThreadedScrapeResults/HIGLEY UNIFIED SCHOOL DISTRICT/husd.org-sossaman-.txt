Announcements
May 3, 2018
Dear Higley Families:
We are happy to announce that schools will reopen on Friday, May 4, and will resume a normal schedule, including before and after-school Kids Club care.
Regarding make-up days: Arizona schools are required to meet a prescribed number of instructional minutes per the state statute. Higley will meet the required number of minutes without extending the current school calendar, which ends May 23. There will be no additional schools days for students.
As a reminder, AP testing and graduation ceremonies will continue as scheduled for high schools.
For any concerns or questions, please contact your school principal.
We look forward to seeing students and employees back to school to finish out the 2017-18 school year strong.
Sincerely,
Dr. Mike Thomason
Superintendent

E-mail communication
Higley Unified School District has launched an APP as another tool for communication with Higley families. The new system will allow schools to send e-mails, as well as push notifications for those who download the app. 
We are excited to offer this new communication tool to our families and look forward to seeing how it grows over the next few months.
Please note: In order to continue receiving e-mail communication, families must have a current, up-to-date e-mail address on file with their schools. The current Constant Contact system will be phased out before the end of the school year. Families that do not have an updated e-mail with the schools may not receive all the communication being sent.
If you have changed your e-mail in the last few months, created a new e-mail or have not provided an e-mail to your school, please do so as quickly as possible.

8th Grade Parent Letter
As we approach the end of the school year, we begin to plan the next step in your student’s academic path; perhaps the most critical as they will take on more responsibility and greater challenges in the years ahead.  Yet, because of your son or daughter’s repeated exhibition of strength, determination, and success in the classroom, I look forward to the wonderful things that await them as they continue to pursue their academic journey.  Our students’ capacity to exceed expectations and make a definitive mark on our community fills me with optimism about what their futures may hold.
In an eagerness to celebrate this milestone, the Higley Unified School District has review and discussed two beneficial means to recognize student success.  Working collaboratively and valuing parent feedback, 8th grade promotion will be recognized with the below noted celebrations. 
First, we look forward to honoring student achievement, distributing yearly awards, and continuing traditions as we host our second annual Evening of Academic and Extra-Curricular Excellence. As we expect, many of our students and families will join us in celebration on Friday, May 18, 2018 beginning at 5:30pm.  Please note if your son or daughter is recognized an invitation will be mailed home early May.
Secondly, students in both academic and good behavioral standing will be extended an invite to Fat Cats on Wednesday, May 23rd from 9:30am until 3:30pm.  Students will spend their final day as Spartans among classmates in friendly competition enjoying games, food, and comradery.  Please look for permission slips to be sent home on Wednesday, February 21st with a $25 incurred cost; which includes unlimited drinks, lunch, and transportation. Checks can be made payable to HUSD#60.
If you should have questions regarding activities taking place in May, I encourage you to contact our campus at 480.279.8513.
Best,
John Dolan, Principal

iPad User Agreement
Sossaman Middle School provides a highly engaging, student centered, interactive curriculum.  We emphasize higher order thinking, encourage self-exploration through various means of growth mindset activities, and 21st Century technology.  Families are encouraged to review the 
iPad User Agreement
 which outlines expectations for student's part of the Higley Unified School District.  In addition, families are afforded the opportunity to enroll in the iPad Protection Plan.  Note this purchase is not required, but highly recommended.

Student Safety
As student safety is our first and foremost priority, we ask that you keep the following in mind:  Please ensure you have state issued identification readily available when checking out a student.  Students will not be released to those not listed in our system or fail to provide proper identification. Additionally, in the event you have a student late to campus, we ask that parents or guardians take the time to come on campus to sign your son and/or daughter in.  This ensures you are aware of your child's whereabouts and student safety.

E-mail Communication – Stay in Touch with Your School
Classes begin July 24. Please visit 
www.husd.org/calendar
 to view the 2017-2018 calendar.  Now is a good time to sign up or update Constant Contact e-mail subscriptions.
These e-mails include weekly information from schools, emergency communication and event updates. Families can also select to receive district and/or Community Education e-mails. To stop receiving e-mail from a particular school, click “unsubscribe” at the bottom of the latest e-mail received. New sign ups can be completed at 
www.husd.org/emailcom
.
Please note: Families can also change/update their e-mail address for Constant Contact (formerly known as E-alert) using the same steps. However, this does not update the e-mail address on file at the school. That must be done at the school office.

ParentVue Reminder
All HUSD families should sign up for a ParentVue account. This allows parents to view student grades and absences, as well as see – when they are posted – class schedules and teacher information. The district also uses ParentVue during class selection times at the middle schools and high schools.
Sign up requires an IN PERSON visit to the school office. If you already have a ParentVue account, and your child is moving from one HUSD school to another, no action is required. The updated information will appear when it is available.
If you have questions, please contact your school's office.
