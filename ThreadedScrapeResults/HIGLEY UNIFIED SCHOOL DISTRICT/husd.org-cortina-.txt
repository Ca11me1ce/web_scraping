Announcements
May 3, 2018
Dear Higley Families:
We are happy to announce that schools will reopen on Friday, May 4, and will resume a normal schedule, including before and after-school Kids Club care.
Regarding make-up days: Arizona schools are required to meet a prescribed number of instructional minutes per the state statute. Higley will meet the required number of minutes without extending the current school calendar, which ends May 23. There will be no additional schools days for students.
As a reminder, AP testing and graduation ceremonies will continue as scheduled for high schools.
For any concerns or questions, please contact your school principal.
We look forward to seeing students and employees back to school to finish out the 2017-18 school year strong.
Sincerely,
Dr. Mike Thomason
Superintendent

HUSD App available to download
Want to stay up on all the news?
The Higley Unified School District App is now available to download! Visit your favorite App store and search for "Higley."
Once downloaded, families can select which schools they wish to receive information from every day - from school calendar updates to social media feeds to notifications.
We are excited to offer this new communication tool to our families and look forward to seeing how it grows over the next few months.
Please note: In order to continue receiving e-mail communication, families must have their current, up-to-date e-mail address on file with their schools.

E-mail communication
Higley Unified School District has launched an APP as another tool for communication with Higley families. The new system will allow schools to send e-mails, as well as push notifications for those who download the app. 
We are excited to offer this new communication tool to our families and look forward to seeing how it grows over the next few months.
Please note: In order to continue receiving e-mail communication, families must have a current, up-to-date e-mail address on file with their schools. The current Constant Contact system will be phased out before the end of the school year. Families that do not have an updated e-mail with the schools may not receive all the communication being sent.
If you have changed your e-mail in the last few months, created a new e-mail or have not provided an e-mail to your school, please do so as quickly as possible.

Cortina Principal Update: March 26
Dear Cortina Families:
In order to provide Cortina with the smoothest transition and with the strongest leadership who already knows the community and students, the district has made the decision to appoint Ms. Kelly Papke as the permanent principal for Cortina Elementary School, effective immediately. Ms. Papke has been an assistant principal at Cortina for five years, and we believe she is the person who can best support the school and community moving forward. 
The district will be conducting a search for a new assistant principal in the upcoming weeks. For the rest of this year, the district has hired Ms. Sophia Patterson, a former teacher within the district with her administration certification and previous administrator experience, to be the interim assistant principal. She will begin tomorrow. We are confident she will be up to speed quickly and be a strong support for Ms. Papke and the school community.
We are excited to have Ms. Papke in this new position as principal of Cortina Elementary School. We know she will do an excellent job and provide stable leadership for the students, staff, and community. Please join us in welcoming her to this new position. 
Sincerely,
Warren Shillingburg, PhD
Associate Superintendent for Educational Services

ParentVue Reminder
 All HUSD families should sign up for a ParentVue account. This allows parents to view student grades and absences, as well as see – when they are posted – class schedules and teacher information. The district also uses ParentVue during class selection times at the middle schools and high schools.
 Sign up requires an IN PERSON visit to the school office. If you already have a ParentVue account, and your child is moving from one HUSD school to another, no action is required. The updated information will appear when it is available.
 If you have questions, please contact your school's office.
