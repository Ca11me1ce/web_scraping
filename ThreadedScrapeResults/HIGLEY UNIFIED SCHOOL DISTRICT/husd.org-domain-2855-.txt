Welcome to 7th grade language arts. This year is going to be a great one!  With a lot of hard work you will accomplish many amazing things. My goal is to be a great support system for you to grow as a learner and become inspired to love writing and reading.  This year we will be reading lots of different text including short stories, plays, novels, poems, biographies, fiction, non- fiction/ informational,  and many more.  
About Ms. Craghead
Hello! My name is Mallory Craghead.  I am excited to be at Cooley Middle School.  I graduated from in Northern Kentucky University with a Bachelor of Education focusing on middle grades, highly qualified in language arts and history. I have a strong passion for learning and I hope to instill that into all of my students. I have lived in Alabama and I came from Kentucky a few years ago. I began my teaching career in Kentucky where I taught 8th grade.  Most recently I came from the Chandler Unified District, however it is my fourth year in the Higley District. I enjoy teaching and I would not have any other career!  My goal is to teach each student to work hard and love learning. Even if reading isn’t “your thing”, you can love this class and continue to grow and get better each and every day. I love to see the progress that each student makes each year. Our slogan around here is “I never lose. Either I win or I learn.” I love this quote because we are ALL learning and growing on a daily basis. Failure is not an option because we learn from our mistakes and just get better!
Availability I make every effort to respond to email within 24 hours. I am also available to you before or after school by appointment; please do not hesitate to let me know if you need to speak with me.      
Course Description This course is structured to provide you with a comprehensive study of grammar, composition, literature, and vocabulary.
