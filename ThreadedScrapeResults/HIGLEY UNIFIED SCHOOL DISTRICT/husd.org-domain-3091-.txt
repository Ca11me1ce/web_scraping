Teacher Announcements
2017-2018 Supply list
Hello 7th Graders!
Welcome to
 Language Arts!
A Little About Me: 
Hello everyone! I am so excited to start school year 2017-2018! I am Mrs. Rogers, and as some of my previous students call me Sgt. Rogers. I will be your Language Arts Teacher and I can't wait to meet you. I graduated with a Bachelors in Arts Degree in Secondary Education, major in English in 2001 from Saint Paul University. Gardening, experiencing the outdoors, riding quads, swimming, pigging out, watching musicals and movies, enjoying the company of friends, and spending time with my family and pets keep me happy and invigorated. Drinking Starbucks makes me smile. Teaching middle-schoolers keep me young.
Please feel free to e-mail me at lael.rogers@husd.org.
Kindly sign up a day or two for tutoring or retakes, there is a sign-up sheet in the classroom. I'm available by appointment only:
Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday 8:20 to 8:45 am
Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday 3:50 to 4:15 pm
For early release days: 
Wednesday 1:35 to 2:00 pm 
Teaching Philosophy:
I know that students retain knowledge if their learning style is catered to. It's important to create a learning environment that provides variety in order to target all multiple intelligences. In my class, you as a student, can expect lectures, readings, group and social activities, movement, singing, and incorporation of videos and technology. There is no one way to learn, hence there is no one way to teach. I embrace all types of learning styles and try to keep that in mind when presenting academic content. In addition, education and learning go hand in hand in molding a scholar. I believe that students need formal academic content and love of learning to become a scholar. What information, content or skills students learn in the four walls of the classroom must be applicable to their lives and the world that has no boundaries. A successful student is one who can go beyond his/her status to rise to become a scholar who loves knowledge and weaves it into his/her life and others lives forever.
How to Succeed in Class
:
Like Glinda, the good witch from the South from The Wizard of Oz, I believe that students have the power within themselves to accomplish great and simple things, they just need to learn and harness that power. I believe that grit, hard work, respect, and discipline are key components for a successful learner. In Cooley Middle School, we believe in Growth Mindset- that "smarts" are not fixed, and that students can become smarter by adopting  to a more learning-oriented behavior. It means that IQ does not fully determine knowledge acquisition and success, but rather having an attitude that "I can" and "It's okay to make mistakes" and "I can give my best" and "I can learn from that", are mindset  and perspective that mold a successful student.
