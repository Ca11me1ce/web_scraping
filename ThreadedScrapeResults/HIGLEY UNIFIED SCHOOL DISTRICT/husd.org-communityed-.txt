Announcements
May 3, 2018
Dear Higley Families:
We are happy to announce that schools will reopen on Friday, May 4, and will resume a normal schedule, including before and after-school Kids Club care.
Regarding make-up days: Arizona schools are required to meet a prescribed number of instructional minutes per the state statute. Higley will meet the required number of minutes without extending the current school calendar, which ends May 23. There will be no additional schools days for students.
As a reminder, AP testing and graduation ceremonies will continue as scheduled for high schools.
For any concerns or questions, please contact your school principal.
We look forward to seeing students and employees back to school to finish out the 2017-18 school year strong.
Sincerely,
Dr. Mike Thomason
Superintendent
