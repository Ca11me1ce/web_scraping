Announcements
May 3, 2018
Dear Higley Families:
We are happy to announce that schools will reopen on Friday, May 4, and will resume a normal schedule, including before and after-school Kids Club care.
Regarding make-up days: Arizona schools are required to meet a prescribed number of instructional minutes per the state statute. Higley will meet the required number of minutes without extending the current school calendar, which ends May 23. There will be no additional schools days for students.
As a reminder, AP testing and graduation ceremonies will continue as scheduled for high schools.
For any concerns or questions, please contact your school principal.
We look forward to seeing students and employees back to school to finish out the 2017-18 school year strong.
Sincerely,
Dr. Mike Thomason
Superintendent

E-mail communication
Higley Unified School District has launched an APP as another tool for communication with Higley families. The new system will allow schools to send e-mails, as well as push notifications for those who download the app. 
We are excited to offer this new communication tool to our families and look forward to seeing how it grows over the next few months.
Please note: In order to continue receiving e-mail communication, families must have a current, up-to-date e-mail address on file with their schools. The current Constant Contact system will be phased out before the end of the school year. Families that do not have an updated e-mail with the schools may not receive all the communication being sent.
If you have changed your e-mail in the last few months, created a new e-mail or have not provided an e-mail to your school, please do so as quickly as possible.

ParentVue
Parents can see student grades and attendance records through a system called “ParentVue.” Teachers post assignments and grades, along with daily attendance, on the system that can then be viewed by parents through a home computer or cell phone. Teachers post links to ParentVue (sometimes referred to as "Online grades") through their teacher webpages. 
You can also reach ParentVue through this link
.
To use ParentVue, parents need a personal code created by their student’s school. Please visit your school office for more information.

Support Centennial and receive up to $400 AZ Tax Credit
The state of Arizona allows you to receive a tax credit of up to $200 ($400 if married and filing jointly) when you make an ECA tax credit donation to our school. We will use your tax dollar donation to help fund extra curricular activities and opportunities for our students to extend their learning beyond the regular school day and you will get a dollar-for-dollar credit towards your tax return. Before and after school tutoring, school clubs and field trip experiences are just a few of the enrichment programs that are made possible when ECA funds are donated to our school. Please name Centennial Elementary School as the recipient of your donation so that we may provide quality enrichment programs like these for our learners. We appreciate your support and are dedicated to spending your tax dollars responsibly.
If you wish to make a donation, please 
see our Tax Credit page
 for more information.
