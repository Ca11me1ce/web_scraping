Announcements
Semi-Formal Dance Canceled
This morning a poll was conducted in 1st hour classes to determine the students interest in attending the school dance scheduled for next Friday. Due to conflicting events on our campus it was determined that less than 50 students planned to attend the final dance of the year. We regret to announce that we have decided to cancel the Semi-Formal scheduled for May 11th from 6-8 p.m. If you have any questions, please contact our Student Council advisor at 
Shannon.Alexander@husd.org
. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

Dear Higley Families:
We are happy to announce that schools will reopen on Friday, May 4, and will resume a normal schedule, including before and after-school Kids Club care.
Regarding make-up days: Arizona schools are required to meet a prescribed number of instructional minutes per the state statute. Higley will meet the required number of minutes without extending the current school calendar, which ends May 23. There will be no additional schools days for students.
As a reminder, AP testing and graduation ceremonies will continue as scheduled for high schools.
For any concerns or questions, please contact your school principal.
We look forward to seeing students and employees back to school to finish out the 2017-18 school year strong.
Sincerely,
Dr. Mike Thomason
Superintendent

Junior Thespian Festival

State Champs
Congratulations to our Cooley Color Guard and CMS/WFHS Winter Winds for earning another state championship title!  Each of these programs has won multiple state titles and it would not be possible without the dedication and hard work of the students along with Mr. Edgar, Ms. Garcia, and Mrs. Edgar!  Congratulations again!

E-mail Communication
Higley Unified School District has launched an APP as another tool for communication with Higley families. The new system will allow schools to send e-mails, as well as push notifications for those who download the app. 
We are excited to offer this new communication tool to our families and look forward to seeing how it grows over the next few months.
Please note: In order to continue receiving e-mail communication, families must have a current, up-to-date e-mail address on file with their schools. The current Constant Contact system will be phased out before the end of the school year. Families that do not have an updated e-mail with the schools may not receive all the communication being sent.
If you have changed your e-mail in the last few months, created a new e-mail or have not provided an e-mail to your school, please do so as quickly as possible.

Cooley Is An "A" Rated School
Cooley Parents and Community Members,
The State of Arizona recently released school rankings.  These rankings, or letter grades, have been calculated differently than years past.  Middle school calculations were based on how well students scored on statewide assessments (AzMerit/AIMS) as well as overall improvement of individual student scores on AzMerit from previous years.  Cooley Middle School continues to show proficiency in all Arizona state assessments:  percentage above the state average in Math, percentage above the state average in English Language Arts, and percentage above charter schools in both Math and English Language Arts.  Growth was also displayed, showing the percentage of students that went from partially proficient to proficient and to proficient to highly proficient. 
I am proud to let you know that Cooley Middle School received an “A” rating.  I cannot express enough how proud I am of the Cooley students, teachers, staff, and community members.  This is something that we should all take great pride in, as this is a tremendous accomplishment.
I believe one of the most basic principles of a successful education is promoting student achievement. My personal goal is to be the best middle school in the state and to oversee a campus which develops young people into ambitious, highly successful, happy, and resilient young adults.  In addition to this, I want to provide your son or daughter with a challenging academic curriculum coupled with an unwavering supportive foundation that values the strength and talent of each individual.  We also want to make learning enjoyable, both socially and emotionally, as we prepare students for their high school journey. Personally speaking, I believe this can all be witnessed daily in walking our campus hallways.
Even with our “A” rating, in continuing with our Growth Mindset philosophy, Mr. Keith and I have reviewed the data provided, and adjustments have been made where we feel will most be beneficial to students.  Our focus will remain on our teachers working together in professional learning communities, making data driven decisions, and incorporating student-centered learning activities into daily instruction. This will help maximize student learning and growth, and more importantly, your student’s readiness for high school and beyond.   
Striving to be the top middle school in the state of Arizona will continue to be our goal.  We greatly value and appreciate your partnership.
Respectfully,
Shawn Varner
Principal, Cooley Middle School

Attendance Policy Changes
This is to inform you that we have a new board policy on attendance.  A student will be considered absent from class if they enter the classroom more than ten minutes after the designated start time.  If the student has a valid reason to be late to class it will be an excused absence. The absence will be considered unexcused if the student is late without being excused by the school administration or the parent signing in the child late.  If you would like to receive attendance updates throughout the day, you have the option to sign up in ParentVUE. Thank you.

Emergency Contact Information
As a reminder, emergency contacts are designated adults that are able to pick up your student when they need to leave school due to a medical emergency. The school cannot release a student to an emergency contact for other reasons such as to go to lunch, appointments, etc.  To release a student during the school day to someone other than a parent/guardian, the school needs parent permission ahead of time.  Thank you!

CMS Front Office Procedure Change
In order to minimize the disruptions to instruction, we are restricting deliveries to students to items that are essential to the educational process. Therefore, classes will not be interrupted for delivery of items.
If it is absolutely necessary to drop off an item for your student, it will be stored in the front office storage area.  Your student can come and get their item between classes or during lunch.  Please note that we are not responsible for dropped off items.
Flowers, birthday items, pizza, etc. will not be accepted from businesses for delivery. Restaurant deliveries are also not allowed including Door Dash, Uber, etc.
The front office will NOT be responsible for delivering items to students.
Please also note that we do our best to deliver phone messages.  Messages are delivered the last 5 minutes of a class period in order to not interrupt instructional time.
Thank you for your understanding!
