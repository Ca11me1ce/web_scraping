Match has been widely recognized and studied for its ability to remediate academic deficits in low-income students and to prepare students for college.
US Department of Education (USDOE)
In 2008, the USDOE recognized Match High School as one of 8 best charter high schools in the country.

US News & World Report
In 2009, US News & World Report ranked Match High School in the top 3% of US public high schools.
Newsweek
In 2007 and 2009, Newsweek ranked Match High School among the top 100 US public high schools.
New Leaders for New Schools and USDOE
Five times between 2008-09 and 2011-12, New Leaders for New Schools and the USDOE recognized Match Middle School and Match High School as EPIC Award winners for student achievement gains on MCAS exams.
Lottery Losers Study
In 2009, labor economists from MIT and Harvard studied Boston charter schools, including the Match Schools, by comparing the test results of their students with the test results of students who 1) generally entered charter school admission lotteries, 2) generally entered charter school admissions lotteries but did not win a seat in a lottery, and thus returned to the Boston Public Schools system (i.e. “lottery losers”). The study found that Boston charter schools have strong positive effects of student test score gains. The study is one of the most rigorous, controlled studies done in the US on charter school outcomes.
