PARCC / mcas RESULTS
The Match 3rd, 4th and 5th graders who took the PARCC test last year arrived at Match as 2nd graders.  They had 12 to 36 months of schooling at Match when they took PARCC last year.  As the data makes clear, they did beautifully on the PARCC exam.
The Match 6th, 7th and 8th graders who took the PARCC exams last year arrived at our middle school in 6th grade.  Like our elementary school students, they performed strongly on PARCC.
In addition, our 10th graders continue their long track record of excellence on the MCAS test. Specifically, 100% and 91% of 10th graders were proficient or advanced on the ELA and math tests, respectively, in 2015-2016.  (Note: the state retained the old MCAS test in 10th grade last year, whereas students in the lower grades took the PARCC exam.)
