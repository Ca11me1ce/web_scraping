All of us here at CPDLF are committed to 
three important principles
 as we work together to become life-long learners:
CONNECT:
  This is a personalized experience where learners (students) and their learning coaches (parents/guardians) are connected and interacting with their Learning Guide and instructors, so everyone is on the same track and working as a team! We expect you to connect every school day, just like any other school!
ENGAGE:
  This is a different way of learning (not just in the fact that it happens online) because learners are actively involved in their own path of learning!  We want you to have a meaningful experience that positively contributes to your own future goals and we will give you the tools to do that.
EMPOWER:
  We will equip you not just with technology but also with relationships and opportunities to meet in person to help you learn and grow.  There will be hard work along the way, but together we can achieve great things!
