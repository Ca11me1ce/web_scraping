About The PTA
The Chicago Park PTA is a non-profit organization included under the banner of The California Congress of Parents.  The PTA consists of volunteers working in the school and community to improve the education, health, and welfare for all children that attend our schools. In the past, PTA has helped fund many essential programs and purchase needed supplies including: the music/drama program, after school sports, the purchase of lap top computers, classroom funds for teachers, assemblies, honor’s bingo, science equipment and much more!
If you are not already a member of our PTA, we encourage you to join us and help make a positive difference for our children. For more information, contact the school office.
For additional information on PTA events and more visit the 
Chicago Park School PTA Facebook Page.
