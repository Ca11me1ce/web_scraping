Science
Science at Chicago Park is brought to life through experiential labs and hands-on learning, with the ultimate goal of preparing our students for biology and chemistry after graduation.   We have two science labs (one for the primary grades and one for grades 4-8), to assist in the teaching of earth, life, and physical sciences. We also utilize our community garden to effectively teach earth and life sciences at all grade levels.  Teachers are participating in on-going professional development to be prepared to implement the New Generation Science Standards when they are adopted by the state of California in 2018.
