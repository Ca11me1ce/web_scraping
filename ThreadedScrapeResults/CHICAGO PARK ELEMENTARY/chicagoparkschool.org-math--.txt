Math
In grades K-5 we use Houghton Mifflin’s Go Math Program (2015 adoption) which is aligned with the Common Core Standards.  We also include a variety of  on-line high interest math programs to meet the individual needs of our students. We supplement these programs with plenty of hands-on learning opportunities that motivate and fully engage our students.
In grades 6-8 we have implemented BIG Ideas Math Program (2015 adoption).  This curriculum focuses on California Common Core Standards.  We combine hands-on project-based learning and traditional math practices to ensure understanding and engagement takes place on a daily basis.  Students are challenged at whatever their math level may be, meeting the needs of students who need remedial support, and those who are ready for Geometry and/or Algebra 2.
