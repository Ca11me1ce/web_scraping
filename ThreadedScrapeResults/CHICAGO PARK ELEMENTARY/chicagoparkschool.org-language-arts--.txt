Language Arts
Language Arts
The teaching of Language Arts is a top priority in the Chicago Park School District. For those that attend K and 1st grade in our programs, our fluent reader rate is over 95%.  We are currently using McGraw-Hill’s Wonders Series in grades TK-5.  We are looking at several options for adoption in grades 6-8.   We use the acclaimed Step-Up-to-Writing Program in grades 2-8, and incorporate the Zaner Blauser Spelling Program in grades 1-8. Good penmanship and oral speaking are practiced at all grade levels. In the upper grades we participate in county sponsored tournaments including: Writing, Spelling and Speech.
