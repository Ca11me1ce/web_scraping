            John M. McKay Scholarship for Children with Disabilities Program        
Required notification to parents/guardians of students with disabilities:
Your child may be eligible to participate in the John M. McKay Scholarship for Students with Disabilities Program for the 2017-18 school year.
In order to be eligible for the McKay Scholarship Program, a student must apply for the program prior to withdrawing from public school. The student must have an Individual Education Plan (IEP), or 504 Accommodation Plan issued under s. 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (with duration of more than six months), and:
* Have been enrolled and reported for funding in a public school for the school year prior to applying for a scholarship (Grades K-12); or
* Have been a prekindergarten student who was enrolled and reported for funding in a Florida public school during the school year prior to applying for a scholarship; or
* Have attended the Florida School for the Deaf and Blind during the preceding school year’s student membership surveys (Grades K-12).
If your child meets these requirements you may receive a scholarship for your child to attend a participating private school. Parents may also choose another public school within the district’s school choice plan or another public school in an adjacent school district. In order for a student to be eligible for the program, an intent to participate in the McKay Scholarship Program must be filed on the Department of Education’s School Choice website (www.floridaschoolchoice.org) prior to withdrawing from public school. The deadline to apply for the first payment period for private school McKay for the 2017-18 school year is July 3, 2017. Parents interested in public school choice McKay need to call the district McKay contact at 352-253-6600.
This notice does not guarantee your student’s eligibility. To learn more about your child’s educational options, contact the Department of Education, Office of Independent Education and Parental Choice Information Hotline at 1-800-447-1636 or visit the website at www.floridaschoolchoice.org and select the John M. McKay Scholarship Program for Students with Disabilities Program option. You may file your intent online.
