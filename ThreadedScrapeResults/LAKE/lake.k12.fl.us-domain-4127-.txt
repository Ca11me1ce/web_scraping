Attendance
Welcome
We have a 96% Attendance Rate!
Minneola Absentee Note
Attendance Policy: 
Dear Parents or Guardians:
          As you know, regular school attendance is essential for students to be successful in school.
   Your child(ren) received a “Student and Family Policy Guide” at the beginning of this school year which explained the Lake County School Attendance Policy.
  In an effort to facilitate this process, we have designed the following brief outline to highlight the basics.
  Please continue to refer to your “Student Policy” as well.
Thank you,
Attendance Office
I. 
Absences: 
  Whenever a student is absent without the permission of the administration of the school, the Parent/Guardian must, within the grading period after the absence, report and 
explain in writing the cause of such absences.
A.
Excused Absences:
  or tardies include the following:
1.
Illness or injury of the student.
2.
Illness or injury of the student’s immediate family necessitating the student’s absence
3.
Death of the student’s immediate family member.
4.
Doctor or dental appointments that cannot be scheduled outside of school hours.
5.
Pre Arranged Absence Form
:Must have educational value and the principal’s prior approval.
These must be requested in writing at least 5 days prior to the absence unless there is an extenuating circumstance.  
***FIVE PREARRANGED ABSENCE DAYS ARE ALLOWED PER SCHOOL YEAR.
6.
Recognized religious holidays.
7.
Judicial Actions-subpoena/summons: Juvenile Detention Center.
B.
Unexcused Absences:
  ALL OTHER ABSENCES OR TARDIES ARE CONSIDERED UNEXCUSED.
II.
Tardies:
  The tardy bell rings at 8:30 a.m.
  Many classes do very important assignments during this time.
  Any arrival after this time is considered “tardy” and the procedures for excusal is the same as the procedures for absences. THREE UNEXCUSED TARDIES OR EARLY DISMISSALS = 1 UNEXCUSED ABSENCE.
III. 
Important Attendance Facts:
A.
Excessive absences:
  More than 10  absences in a semester is considered excessive
.
  A written statement from a licensed practicing physician verifying illness or injury must be provided after that point in order for the absence to be excused.
B.
Habitual Truant: 
 The legal definition is a student who has 15 unexcused absences within 90 calendar days, with or without the knowledge or justifiable consent of the parent or legal guardian.
  Students and families violating the state truancy law may face court action [FS: 1003.27-1003.29].
C.
Make-up Work:
  Students are responsible for making arrangements with the teacher to make up 
all work and assignments within a 5-day period after their return to school.
  Arrangements are made with the teacher and are the responsibility of the student.
  In case of long term assignments, the work must be turned in the day of the student’s return.
  Work submitted after that day will result in a grade reduction of no more than 10% per day.
  Any student checking in or out on the day that a long term assignment is due MUST turn in the assignment by the end of that day in order for it to be accepted.
