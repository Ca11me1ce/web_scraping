Please start cutting and saving Box Tops for our school. We receive .10 for every Box Top turned in. You can send them in with your child preferably in an envelope with the number of box tops included. Have them drop them off in the mornings in Mrs. Locuson's classroom (#604). Your child will receive credit for that amount turned in for any contest we hold.
Here is a list of 
Participating Products
  and a 
Collection Form
 sheet to collect your box tops.
Go Falcons!
