Welcome
Dear Students and Families,
I am so excited to be a part of the Minneola Elementary Charter School family. 
This is my second year teaching at MECS, prior to that I had taught in private schools working with children with special needs for four years. I use several different modes of teaching because I believe each child learns in his or her own way. I include a lot of sensory activities to enhance the learning experience.
I studied at Auburn University and University of Central Florida. I have certifications in Prekindergarten-Primary Education (Age 3- Grade 3) and Exceptional Student Education (Grades K-12). I have also expanded my training with some Montessori and the Lindamood-Bell Reading and Language Programs. 
I continue to try to acquire skills that will aid in being a better teacher. I love
 psychologist Gardner’s Theory on Multiple Intelligences; 
it centers around the talents and 
strengths of each individual person and then encourages you to teach accordingly.
I am a Florida native, growing up in Maitland and moved to Clermont 
about a two years ago. I come from a very artistic family and have always enjoyed getting messy when learning! I 
love animals of every kind, I have two dogs- Remi and JoJo! Some of my hobbies are: singing, arts and crafts, kayaking, going to Disney, dancing, rowing, bike riding, watching football, fishing and spending time with my family- Especially my nephew. 
Remember, your child’s success in the classroom is enhanced by practice at home. I welcome your communication at any time. Feel free to contact me to discuss any concerns you might have. Please 
join Remind
, it is a communication tool (through an app, email, or texts) that allows parents and teachers to communicate with ease. To the left you will see different tabs including Newsletters, a Calendar, and important classroom information. 
I am thrilled to work with your child and you to make the most of this important year! Welcome to Kindergarten!
Miss Callie Godwin
