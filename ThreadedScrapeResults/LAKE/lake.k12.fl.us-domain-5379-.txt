Admission and Enrollment Information
Welcome
Minneola Charter Schools (MCS) is as a school choice option available to parents.  We would like to thank you for your consideration of MCS as an option to eductate you child(ren).  Each school is different, and we understand your desire to make sure you choose a school that best fits the needs of your child and family.  While MCS is the right school for many students, it may not be the right fit for everyone.  Before you apply, please take the time to learn more about us by reviewing our Student Admission and Registartion Policy and Enrollment Eligibility Policies (two links below), peruse the rest of the MCS website, visit us on Facebook and Twitter @MinneolaCharter. 
Once you determine if your child(ren) are eligible for enrollment at MCS, and MCS fits your family needs, we invite you to complete an 
admission application
. When you are filling out the admission application be sure to complete the application accurately and completely as an incorrect or incomplete application can result in your child's application not being considered for enrollment.  Applications and wait lists are only good for the school year in which the student is applying.  Applications and wait lists do not carry over from year to year.  
Controlled Open Enrollment Seat Capacity Determination: Maximum seat capacity at MCS is determined by the most recently approved charter contract and applicable amendments to the charter contract between Lake County Schools (LCS) and MCS, and state law.  Kindergarten (KG) through 3rd grade may have a school average of no more than 18 students, and 4th through 8th grade many have a school average of no more than 22 students.  The 2018-2019 school year maximum seat capacity must meet state class size mandates, and must not exceed 1330 seats in grade Kindergarten (KG) through sixth (6).  The School may serve Pre-K with capacity to be determined annually.  
Again, thank you for considering Minneola Charter Schools as the educational choice for your family. We hope you find what you are looking for as you evaluate one of the most important choices you'll make as a parent.  Of course, we hope you choose Minneola Charter Schools, as we believe in community, family, the power of parental choice, and in the fact that MCS is a fantastic school!  Our best referals come from those with students who have attended and are currently attending.  
Enrollment Dates for the 2018-2019 school year:    
January 16-26, 2018: Intent to Return Period - This is the communication period provided for currently enrolled students to notify MCS if they will return for the 2018-2019 school year.  Intent to Return forms were sent home with students and were also available to parents through an electronic form link.
February 5-23, 2018-2019: Open Admission Applications Window - This window is open to new students wishing to apply for admission for the 2018-2019 school year, and those currently enrolled MCS students who missed the Intent to Return notification period. The Admission Applications were available to parents through an electronic form link.  
March 15, 2018 - Admission Applications reopen and remain open for any open student seats for the 2018-2019 school year.  Applications are not accepted through email, fax, or paper (mailed or delivered).  Please use the correct form for the grade level you are applying.  The Admission Application is available
