Missing Student Glasses
Parents, Ever wondered where your student's prescription glasses may have ended up?  If they are lost at school they end up in the MECS Clinic.  Click the title to see the most reason lot of our found student glasses.  If they belong to your child, please send a note in to your child's teacher so we can get the glasses back to their owner.  Thanks!

Hurricane Irma Makeup Days Announced
To make up the instructional hours missed because of Hurricane Irma, there will be no early release on Dec. 18, Dec. 19, Dec. 20, May 22, May 23 and May 24 to equal six hours or one instructional day. Additionally, classes will be held on March 30, formerly a non-student day. With the Florida Department of Education Commissioner’s decision to waive two days and the extra instructional time the district had built into the student calendar, Lake County students do not need to make up any additional hours.
