Hartland Lakeside Athletics Program
Hartland Lakeside School District is proud to offer a diverse athletics program for elementary school and middle school children alike. Through our leadership as athletes and educators, we will inspire the community and raise awareness on the importance of inclusive sport and play opportunities for all kids.
Elementary Athletics
The intramural program is designed to introduce all students to a team sports community at a early age while giving them opportunities to play on the same team as other classmates.
