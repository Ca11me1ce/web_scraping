Biography
What I love about teaching is… sharing enthusiasm for my subject matter.
I have been teaching at North Shore Middle School since the fall of 2008.  I helped to create and implement the theater and movie making classes at North Shore and continue to help it change and grow every year.  In theater classes, students learn how to create characters, act as an ensemble onstage, write scripts, and will discover how theater has changed since ancient times.  Students use costumes, props, and the stage to bring their scripts to life.  In movie making classes, students learn how to film and edit their own footage to look like professional movies.  Students use video cameras and computers to create commercials, newscasts, stop motion films, movie trailers, short films, and more.  I also co-direct the fall play and spring musical for our drama club and manage the stage crew.

Biography
My name is Ann-Marie Meissner and I am the District Nurse at Hartland North, Hartland South and North Shore Middle School. My nursing degree is from Carroll College (now Carroll University) and I received my National Certification in School Nursing in the spring of 2014. The 2014 – 2015 school year marks my fifth year in the Hartland Lakeside School District.
I have been a fan of the Hartland Lakeside School District ever since my oldest son, Christopher, started 5K here in 1997. Since then my two younger children, Emily and Benjamin, have attended school here as well. I am extremely lucky to now be working with such an awesome group of educators.
I truly enjoy building relationships with students, especially those with long-term health care needs. I have also enjoyed the opportunity to help teach the Human Growth and Development curriculum for the 5th through 8th graders. Every day brings a new adventure!

Biography
What I love about teaching is the progressive interactions with students as they grow and learn. Watching a child discover their world, each other, and themselves is truly a priceless experience.
After working for over a decade as a Human Resources manager in the private sector, I decided to pursue my dream of working in education. In 2008, I received my teaching certificate from Carroll University and began the journey into the teaching field…and never looked back.
With my business background, I currently specialize in our LIFE Charter entrepreneurship and business classes, which include economics, marketing, business planning and development and personal finance. With a social studies and math minor, I also teach 6th, 7th and 8th grade math.
My teaching philosophy is simple – My own children attend the phenomenal schools in this district, and I view the educational experience of my students as important as the experiences of my own children. Each and every one deserves a high-quality education that supports the whole child – mind, body and soul.

Biography
As the principal of both North Shore Middle School and LIFE Charter, I’d like to welcome you to our website! I am beginning my sixth year as the middle school principal at Hartland-Lakeside. As we all know middle school is a time of immense change for adolescents, which makes my job both challenging, but extremely rewarding and humbling!
I am currently enrolled in the Educational Leadership and Policy Analysis (ELPA) program at UW-Madison, and I’m working on obtaining my doctorate in Educational Leadership. My other interests include spending time with my family and friends, traveling, anything on HGTV, reading, and getting out on the lake when the weather permits!
If you are interested in learning more about either North Shore Middle School, LIFE Charter, or our other offerings, please contact me at

Biography
What I love about teaching is having the opportunity to make music with young adults every day. The musical transformation students make from beginning band to 8th grade band is extraordinary and that, for me, is what keeps reaffirming my love of music.
Mrs. Sundstrom has been the Instrumental Music Director for the Hartland-Lakeside School District for 9 years. Before coming to Hartland, Mrs. Sundstrom taught middle school and high school bands in the Madison area. Mrs. Sundstrom graduated with honors from UW-Eau Claire in May 2003.
The Hartland-Lakeside Band Program offers many musical opportunities for our instrumentalists. There are concert bands in each grade beginning in 5th grade. Our highly esteemed Jazz Band meets before school on Mondays and Wednesdays. Instrumental students can also participate in the following events: NSMS Fall Play Pit Band, Breakfast with Santa in December, Solo and Ensemble in March, and the ever popular Spring Festival Trip to Gurnee, IL. The NSMS Jazz Band performs an annual District Tour in the Spring as well as an annual performance at Hartland Music in February. We partner with a number of community members and regional musicians to provide lessons and sectionals for our instrumental students.

Biography
What I love about teaching is working alongside my students as they read, write, think, and grow while developing their own personal identities.
Bio: Beth Wartzenluft:
I grew up in Hartland, WI and have spent the last 20 years teaching in Waukesha. I am proud to be back in a district where I was once a student! Students in my class engage in thoughtful, purposeful, meaningful work with literacy each day. We run a workshop format for literacy, which allows for the differentiation of each student as we grow as readers, writers, and thinkers. We are a community of learners who respect each other, ask meaningful questions, and enjoy the journey we are on together.

Biography
This is my 16th year in the Hartland Lakeside School District.  I graduated from UW-Stevens Point with a Bachelors degree in Psychology  and German.  I went on to UW-Oshkosh where I received my Master of Education in School Counseling.  In 2013 I attended Cardinal Stritch and obtained a Masters in Educational Leadership.
I live in the Hartland community with my three children who have all gone through the district.  I enjoy traveling, reading, shopping and spending time with family.  
I really enjoy my role in encouraging all the children to strive for their personal best.  I am thrilled to be working with the students, teachers, administrators, and parents whom I so highly regard.   Please don’t hesitate to contact me if I can help you or your child in any way.
