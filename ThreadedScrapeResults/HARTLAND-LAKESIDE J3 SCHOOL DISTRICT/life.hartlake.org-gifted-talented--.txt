Philosophy of Hartland-Lakeside School District
The Hartland/Lakeside School District acknowledges and values the talent in all its students. The process of screening, identification, and service delivery for gifted and talented has been developed in order to meet the unique needs of all learners. Within the context of the 21st century learner, programming for gifted and talented learners does not occur in isolation, rather, it is embedded in the context of the school environment in order to establish a school community that is responsive to the needs of all students. A wide range of learning opportunities must be provided for students identified as gifted and talented in order to extend, expand, and enrich the exceptional capabilities and interests of gifted students in one or more of the following areas: general intelligence; specific academic ability; creativity; visual or performing arts; leadership. The majority of services provided for students, who have been identified as gifted and talented, are provided within the general education classroom. The Hartland Lakeside School District believes that differentiated curriculum is essential for meeting the needs of all learners in the classroom. Within the context of the classroom, students must be provided rich learning opportunities in order to build critical thinking skills, expand their problem solving ability, enhance their oral and written communication, and to expand their ability to collaborate with the community and the world.
The Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction’s Comprehensive Integrated Programming Model for Gifted Education served as a foundation for the Hartland Lakeside School District’s gifted education and talented service delivery philosophy.
Please contact your principal with inquiries about Gifted and Talented Programming at Hartland-Lakeside School District.
