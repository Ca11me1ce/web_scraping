Experiential Learning & External Opportunities
Students in grades nine through twelve undertake a traditional college-preparatory curriculum, including Advanced Placement courses, that introduces them to the course scheduling they will encounter in college. The SEED School offers a wide range of elective courses, such as entrepreneurship, service learning, and African American History, that build upon the core content courses and provide a more challenging and enriching learning experience in the subjects that interest students most.
We are proud to announce that our High School achieved Tier 1 status in 2017!

Every year, the DC Public Charter School Board (PCSB) releases School Quality Report. These are the results of an annual, multiple measure evaluation used to track school performance across the city. Our School Performance Report for 2017 is available for download here.
College Transition & Success Services
Once a student graduates from SEED, our relationship with that student doesn’t simply end there. 
The SEED Foundation
 has a program that provides additional support through the college years to help ensure that The SEED School of Washington, D.C. graduates become college graduates. CTS offers a variety of services, including financial aid advising, career advising, and outreach to universities. You can read more about CTS services
