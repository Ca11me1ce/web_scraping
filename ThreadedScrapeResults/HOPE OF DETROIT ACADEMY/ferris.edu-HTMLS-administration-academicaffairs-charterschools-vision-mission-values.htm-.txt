Vision, Mission, and Core Values  - Charter Schools
Vision, Mission, and Core Values 
Vision
Ferris State University will authorize public school academies that promise to transform                                       the lives of students by demonstrating high-quality performance.                                    
Mission
The Ferris State University Charter Schools Office focuses on student success and                                       continuous improvement through quality oversight, professional learning opportunities,                                       and relevant resources for its authorized public school academies.                                     
Core Values
The core values of the Ferris State University Charter Schools Office are the foundation                                       of our organization's culture. Our values are static, unchanging and non-negotiable,                                       built from the belief that learning is a lifelong process and all students can learn.                                    
We Value
Student Learning
As a higher education institution, student learning is in our DNA; we see the opportunities                                       created when students succeed, and we focus our oversight and support efforts on continual                                       student success.                                    
A Collaborative Working Environment
By supporting each other and building partnerships, we encourage a sense of community                                       through cooperation, teamwork and consensus building with our stakeholders.                                    
Diversity
Recognizing that stakeholders are made up of diverse populations, we honor diversity                                       of ideas, beliefs, and cultures.                                    
Opportunities
Through the work we do as a charter school authorizer, we help create learning opportunities                                       and environments by lending support for professional growth and development.                                    
Excellence
Committed to superior results, we engage in practices that produce the highest quality                                       outcomes in all our endeavors.                                    
Accountability
Accountability leads to academic progress-we believe in being held accountable for                                       our work as an authorizer as deeply as we believe in holding all stakeholders accountable                                       for their work.                                    
Integrity and Trust
Our actions are guided by fairness and respect through transparency, effective communication                                       and the building of positive relationships with each other and our stakeholders.
