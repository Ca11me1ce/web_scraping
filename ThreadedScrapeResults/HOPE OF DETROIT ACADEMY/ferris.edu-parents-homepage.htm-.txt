Your student has made one of the most important decisions of his or her life - the                              selection of Ferris State University as the path that will lead to a successful future.                           
Our founders, Woodbridge and Helen Ferris, had high expectations when they opened                              the Ferris Industrial School in 1884. Those goals are part of our university’s mission                              today: to prepare students for successful careers, responsible citizenship and life-long                              learning.                           
We know that you share those expectations and goals for your student. We also believe                              that together - Ferris faculty and staff, parents and your student - we can work to                              achieve those goals that were envisioned by our founders.
