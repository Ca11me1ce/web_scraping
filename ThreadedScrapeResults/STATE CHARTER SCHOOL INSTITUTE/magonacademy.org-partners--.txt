Fuel Up to Play 60
Empowering Students to Take Charge
Fuel Up to Play 60 is a program founded by the National Dairy Council and NFL, in collaboration with USDA, that empowers students to take charge in making small, everyday changes at school. Students can win cool prizes, like an NFL player visit or Super Bowl tickets, for choosing good-for-you foods and getting active for at least 60 minutes every day. We want kids to make a difference not only in their lives, but also their community.

Great Schools
Helping Parents Find Great Schools
In 1998, GreatSchools Founder and CEO Bill Jackson launched GreatSchools.org to use the power of the Internet to help parents get more informed and engaged in their children’s education. GreatSchools started as a local guide to Silicon Valley schools, reaching 3,000 visitors the first year. Today, we are the leading national source of school information for parents, reaching 52 million annual unique visitors and more than half of American families with children. As a nonprofit organization, GreatSchools is supported through advertising and licensing revenues, as well as by foundations and donors. Thanks to this support, GreatSchools helps a growing number of parents find great schools, support great learning, and guide their kids to great futures.
