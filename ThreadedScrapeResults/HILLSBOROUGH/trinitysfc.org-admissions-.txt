, Admissions Director
Welcome from the Director
Welcome to Trinity School for Children and showing interest in our programs. It is our hope that in exploring our web site, you will gain an understanding of our concentration. Our work with students is directed toward the teaching of the "whole child", intellectually, physically, emotionally, spiritually, and socially.
Since opening our doors in August 1999, our curriculum focus has been on the single most organizing principle of education, which is in order for children to learn in school and to become life-long learners, they must interact with their environment (people, places, and things) and interpret their experiences. As a result of our work with students, they have proven to be critical thinkers, know much about the global community and their place in it, and become good democratic citizens.
We encourage diversity in our student body, staff, and programs. Our parents are our partners in their child's growth and development. Our name, "Trinity", is representative of the interaction that occurs between our educators, families and the greater community. 
Trinity is a special place and we encourage you to stop by and visit our campus and classrooms and experience the Trinity magic!
