Struggling Learners
Struggling Learners
A scholar may underperform academically for a number of reasons. Generally, children want to do well in school. However, sometimes obstacles beyond their control make is difficult for them to succeed. In traditional schools, children sometimes struggle academically when they face bullying, intimidation, medical issues, learning issues, or other emotional situations. Both the reasons why and the ways in which they struggle vary so widely which often makes it difficult for schools to identify and support each child individually. With the already limited resources and time available at a traditional brick-and-mortar school, it can be a frustrating challenge for the family trying to help their struggling learner.
If you have a child who is struggling at their current school (whether from academic challenges or social-emotional issues), consider a situation in which distractions are removed or minimized, curriculum is personalized, instruction is provided one-on-one, and the schedule is flexible. Imagine being able to provide this unique education in your own home, having your child surrounded by those who truly love him or her. Families of struggling scholars need educational choices that allow them to protect and support their scholar at home while providing for them academically as well. 
The dedicated staff of Compass Charter Schools (CCS) is sensitive to the needs of the struggling scholar. We understand their desire for flexibility and a quality personalized learning experience, and are proud to offer our Compass Experience to meet their unique needs. 
Both our Online and Homeschool programs provide the flexibility that families desire while maintaining the academic consistency they need. In addition, our 
counseling team
 is available to help provide even more support to help the scholar succeed. CCS also offers various 
field trips, enrichment activities and clubs
 for scholars that seek an additional enrichment experience. 
Our 
Online Program
 offers a virtual education with caring, dedicated teachers who provide live online classes each week. In addition, teachers offer a weekly Q&A session to offer added support when scholars need more help with their work. High School courses provide subject-specific credentialed teachers just as you would find in a brick-and-mortar school. Our teachers truly want to see each scholar succeed. 
Our 
Homeschool (Options) Program
 is for the parent looking to be the primary instructor for the scholar. We provide instructional funds, school support staff and a team of Educational Facilitators (EF) ready to provide academic guidance, support and encouragement as scholars experience school at home. Compass provide families with $2,800 in allocated instructional funds for K-8 scholars and $3,000 for scholars in grades 9-12. These allocated funds are for use with our approved vendors. Our team of EFs support and guide the scholar and learning coach / parent as they partner with families on the scholar’s educational journey.
Compass Charter Schools is proud to be able to support young athletes as they work hard to balance their sports and educational careers.
