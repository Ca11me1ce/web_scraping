Gifted Children
Satisfying the unending curiosity of a gifted child can be a joy and a challenge. Because gifted children tend to develop asynchronously, it can be a challenge to educate them. Asynchronous, as far as advanced learners are concerned, means that intellectual levels may be several grade levels ahead of the actual age, however emotional (and social) maturity may be several levels below. Therefore, in a traditional classroom, gifted children are often misunderstood because they may become bored and then disrupt others because of that boredom. In addition, it is often difficult for traditional schools to support the needs of gifted children due to budget constraints. CCS has a unique opportunity to assist gifted scholars in their education because of the unique learning environment it provides.
The dedicated staff of Compass Charter Schools (CCS) are sensitive to the needs of gifted children. We understand their desire for flexibility and a quality personalized learning experience, and are proud to offer our Compass Experience to meet their unique needs. Both our Online and Homeschool programs provide the flexibility that families desire while maintaining the academic consistency they need. In addition, our 
counseling team
 is available to help provide even more support to help the scholar succeed. CCS also offers various 
field trips, enrichment activities and clubs
 for scholars that seek an additional enrichment experience. 
Our 
Online Program
 offers a virtual education with caring, dedicated teachers who provide live online classes each week. In addition, teachers provide a weekly Q&A session to offer added support when scholars need more help with their work. High School courses are supported by subject-specific credentialed teachers just as you would find in a brick-and-mortar school. Our teachers truly want to see each scholar succeed. 
Our
Homeschool (Options) Program
 is for the parent looking to be the primary instructor for the scholar. We provide instructional funds, school support staff and a team of Educational Facilitators (EF) ready to provide academic guidance, support and encouragement as scholars experience school at home. Compass provides families with $2,800 in allocated instructional funds for K-8 scholars and $3,000 for scholars in grades 9-12. These allocated funds are for use with our approved vendors. Our team of EFs support and guide the scholar and learning coach/parent as they partner with families on the scholar’s educational journey.
CCS’ Online and Homeschool Programs can provide ways for a gifted child to excel through a personalized education. This educational model supports them through their challenges at a pace that is more flexible and allows them the freedom to grow into their academic potential.
