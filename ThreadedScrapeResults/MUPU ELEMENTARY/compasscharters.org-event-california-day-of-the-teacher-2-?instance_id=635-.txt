California’s Day of the Teacher has its roots in the community and is patterned after the celebration of the traditional “El Dia del Maestro,” which is observed in Mexico and Latin America countries. Our California’s Day of the Teacher arose out of legislation co-sponsored by CTA and the Association of Mexican American Educators in 1982. Since then, this event honors the instructional excellences in our public schools, community colleges and universities.California communities share our goals for quality public schools and recognize public education is the cornerstone for strong communities. Scholars are at the center of everything we do and as committed, caring education professionals, we look forward to building relationships with parents, community organizations, local businesses, other unions, the faith community and senior citizens. We are all part of a community and we will best succeed when we work together.
