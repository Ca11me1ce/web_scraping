Parent Advisory Council
Parent Advisory Council
The Parent Advisory Council serves to provide parent feedback on school policies and procedures at Compass Charter Schools to ensure that they are consistent with its Mission, Vision, and Values.
Members act as a committed group of advisors to the staff and administration, regarding issues that affect the scholars and school of CCS. They provide feedback and insight from the parent’s perspective on school process, policies and initiatives to ensure that the needs of parents and their families are included as decisions are made. They also serve as an advisory, not a decision-making body, that makes recommendations, encourages brainstorming and provides opportunities for parent involvement on committees.

Therese Nordstrom Christopher | Member
I grew up in a small town in Sweden, where I went to school and learned several different languages. I have worked in the restaurant business, as well as with the local tourist board in my home town. I wanted to explore the world, and did so by traveling to Spain, England, and eventually coming to California in my early twenties, where I met my husband. We have a daughter who has been attending CCS for the past 2 1/2 years, and we are very exited to be involved with the development of the school. I currently work as an administrator/human resource manager at a local art gallery in Southern California and our family lives in Corona del Mar, CA.

Joy Elizabeth Sterling Effie | Member
After serving in the U.S. Marine Corps within Food Services, I attended the University of San Diego becoming a certified Paralegal. I later worked as a Private Duty CNA Hospice Nurse, Funeral Director, and Skilled Nursing Admissions Coordinator. I transitioned into sales where I managed 3 retail stores. I raised my oldest son as a single parent, who graduated with a degree in Biblical Studies and later returned to college becoming an Exotic Animal Trainer & Educator. After having two children in my 40’s, I regularly volunteered in their elementary school classrooms, at Church, as a Cub Scout Den Leader, and as a Girl Scout Troop Leader. Upon the children pursuing acting, I began managing their careers finding it necessary for them to homeschool. We have been with CCS for four years.
Galit Gordon | Member
I have been a Learning Coach for my daughter for 7 years, the past three at CCS, and love every minute of it, even the challenging moments. I graduated from the University of Phoenix with a Bachelors of Science in Computers and a Masters of Science in Computers with a specialty in eBusiness. I am an Army veteran of six years, have lived in Australia, Israel, Germany, US Virgin Islands, Maryland, Washington, DC, Raleigh, NC, San Francisco and currently in beautiful Carlsbad, California. My son (who just graduated Kuma Sum Laude with a degree in Computer Programming) and I have created a video game news website close to five years ago and have over 24,000 followers. I am very excited about being on the Parents Advisory Council because I strongly believe that it we, the Learning Coaches, who truly understand what makes our children grow and thrive as online learners and we have a wealth of knowledge and advice to share with the learning community.

Marissa Peralta | Member
I am a proud parent of a scholar at CCS, and also have a 3-year old (honorary member). I earned my B.A. in Biology and English Literature from Dominican University of California in 2005, while also serving in the U.S. Air Force Reserves. I have over 10 years of experience in social justice and community development, through advocacy and paralegal assistance at various non-profits in the S.F. Bay Area. I am currently attending law school at Empire College in Santa Rosa, CA. Upon completion, my desire is to focus on the legal aspect of disability rights, to ensure that all students are provided with an equal opportunity to quality education and professional development.
Lisa Robotham | Council Chair
Lisa has four (4) kids. Two (2) are grown and college graduates and two (2) are attending CCS. She has been on numerous athletic boards and has worked six (6) years at elementary brick and mortar schools. She was a Dance Teacher early in life for 10 years and that is where she developed her desire to work with children and parents. She also worked in the home mortgage industry for over 10 years and had various jobs in the manufacturing industry. She finally finished her education in 2009, earning her much-desired associates degree by taking classes online at Ashford University. She sells Avon products and lives in Palmdale, CA.

SoCal native mother of five, a party wherever they go.  Six years of Idaho snow was fun for skiing, but not for driving, so she is enjoying the beaches once again. Accidental home educator with one graduate and one on the way.
