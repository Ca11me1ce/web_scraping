Charter Schools
PUBLIC SCHOOLS OPERATED BY A GROUP OF PARENTS, TEACHERS AND/OR COMMUNITY MEMBERS AS SEMI-AUTONOMOUS SCHOOLS OF CHOICE AUTHORIZED BY A SCHOOL DISTRICT						
The charter school operates under a charter (a contract) between the charter school and its sponsor (school district).
A public charter school is subject to certain laws pertaining to school district public schools, is released from others and must operate consistent with the charter agreement (contract).
Public charter schools were created to provide innovative, flexible and creative educational choices for students and their parents. Although charter schools are exempt from some state and district regulations, they are held to extremely high levels of accountability. In addition to meeting state accountability requirements, charter schools must also meet the requirements set out in their charter and agreed to by their sponsor.
