				Special Education Services			
	Print
Minnesota Online High School provides a continuum of services for students who qualify for special education services. Because we are an online high school and do not have a bricks-and-mortar site, for some students this may mean contracting with or purchasing programming from other entities. Students are expected to stay in close touch with their special education case managers while enrolled in our school.
In addition to working with the MNOHS special education staff to develop and implement IEPs, students who qualify may enroll in these MNOHS courses which provide additional support:
Essential Math
Essential Language Arts
Essential Skills
Transition
Please see our 
course descriptions page
 for details about these and other MNOHS courses.
Special Education Staff
Gigi Krause, Special Education Director
