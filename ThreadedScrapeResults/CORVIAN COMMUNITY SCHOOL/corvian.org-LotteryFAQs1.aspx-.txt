Lottery FAQs		
How old does my child need to be to register for Kindergarten?
An eligible child must be five years old on or before August 31 to register as a Kindergarten student. No exceptions will be made. 
Do I have to be a resident of North Carolina in order to participate in the lottery?
Yes, as mandated by the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction, Division of Charter Schools. Students, parents, or legal guardians, must be domiciled as legal residents with a permanent home in a NC school district to be eligible for charter school admission. The domiciliary must be in place at the time of the student application in order for that particular application to gain consideration in the charter school lottery. 
I have multiple birth siblings (twins, triplets, etc.). How does that work?
If multiple birth siblings apply for admission to a charter school and a lottery is needed under G.S. 115C-238.29F(g)(6), the charter school shall enter one surname into the lottery to represent all of the multiple birth siblings. If that surname of the multiple birth siblings is selected, then all of the multiple birth siblings shall be admitted. To learn more,

How will I receive my lottery number?
Following the submission of your online application you will immediately receive a confirmation email to the email you entered on the application. It will contain your registration content and your unique registration number.
If you submitted your paper/printed registration prior to the January 31 deadline, you will receive an email confirmation with your registration content and your unique registration number.
It is your responsibility to make sure your application was received. If you do not receive a confirmation email, please contact us at 
lottery@corvian.org
My family is entered under one lottery number. How do I find out the admission status for ALL of my children?
Upon registering for the Corvian lottery, you choose which child would represent your family in the lottery (the first child listed on your application). You will find your registration number on that wait list ONLY. If that child is admitted AND you accept the spot, your remaining children will be placed on a sibling priority wait list for their respective grades. We will notify you immediately if a spot becomes available.
If my child is admitted through the lottery or from the wait list, how many days do I have to accept/confirm the spot?
Following the lottery and movement of the wait list, families who have been admitted will be formally notified by an email from the admissions office. Once this email is received, families have seven (7) calendar days to formally accept their spot(s) at Corvian. Formal acceptance will be in the form of submitting a complete enrollment packet. Failure to formally accept within the seven calendar day period will constitute forfeiture of the child's spot. The admissions office will continue to move down the wait list until all available spots are filled.
How often can I check my wait list status?
We understand how interested you are in your child’s wait list status. However, it is quite typical that our wait lists will move very little, if at all, before summer. There are many factors that prevent us from being able to predict when and to what degree the wait list will move. Rest assured, you will be contacted immediately if a spot becomes available for your child.
Please refrain from calling the front desk for updates. You may email 
info@corvian.org
 with wait list questions.
