Stacey Haskell graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Accounting from George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia.

Stacey and her husband Mark Haskell moved to the Charlotte area to start a new business in 2006. They reside in Huntersville with their two small daughters. As Corvian's Director and Founder, Stacey's strong commitment to educational opportunities for all children and young adults shines in everything that she does. She values the importance of smaller class sizes, an individualized approach to educating the whole child though arts based education and providing a flexible and supportive working environment to passionate, creative teachers. Stacey wants Corvian Community School to provide this for the children of our community. Doing what is best for kids by providing research-based, brain-friendly instruction in classrooms that emphasize a commitment to the arts, service to the community, a rigorous, differentiated curriculum and a safe, nurturing climate for learning, Stacey Haskell is pleased to be able to live out her beliefs and commitments by beginning an excellent public charter school in the Charlotte area.        
Nicki Sinclair

Nicki Sinclair graduated with her Bachelor’s degree in Secondary Education/ English from Kutztown University of Pennsylvania in 1998, and her Master’s degree in Executive Leadership in 2011 from Gardner Webb University. She started teaching 8th grade language arts in Davidson County for five years before moving to Charlotte in 2003. In CMS she taught high school English and middle school language arts for several years. Nicki then had the opportunity to begin teaching at another local charter school where she taught 7th grade language arts for seven years and was the team leader for three of those years. During her time as team leader, Nicki very much enjoyed collaborating directly with other teachers, facilitating meetings, and building rapport among the grade level. This experience of leading her grade-level team helped her to realize her love for helping teachers and positively impacting students on an administrative level. 
Nicki's belief in seeing  students as individual learners with individual needs is what drew her to Corvian Community School in 2015.   She helped grow and lead the middle school with the addition of 6th, 7th, and 8th grades.  Nicki is excited to now be leading the high school while continuing to uphold Corvian’s core values.  
Nicki lives in the University Area with her husband Drew, and two children, Allison and Ben. She enjoys horseback riding, yoga, biking, acrylic painting, and spending time with her family.

Kristi Miller		
Director of Elementary Education            
Kristi Miller graduated from Furman University with a Bachelor of Arts in Elementary Education and received a Master of Education degree from Converse College. However, Kristi’s best educational opportunity has been partnering with her husband, Chris, in parenting their two college-age girls. Mary Gwen and Sarah are her best teachers, and her greatest source of joy!
During her teaching career, Kristi has collaborated with teachers and administrators to create educational plans that were driven by both data and research on best practices, written elementary curriculum, and worked closely with families to design programs that engage students and ignite a love of learning.  When her girls entered school at one of the few public Basic Schools in North Carolina, Kristi fell in love with the philosophy. She was a parent leader at that school for many years before her family moved on to a local charter school where she served on the Board of Directors.  Professional development opportunities introduced Kristi to Corvian Community School in 2013. The pure joy and passion every staff member has for what they do convinced Kristi that she had to be a part of this growing school.  Since coming to Corvian, she has been a Literary Facilitator, 3rd grade teacher, and 5th grade teacher.
Kristi lives in Highland Creek with her husband, Chris, and always looks forward to  the times when Mary Gwen and Sarah are home, too.  She is a huge Panthers fan and loves nothing more than being at the stadium on a crisp autumn afternoon to watch her Panthers win. Kristi also enjoys sewing and quilting, traveling with her family, and serving in her church.

After graduating, she married her high school sweetheart, PJ, and moved to Fort Riley, Kansas where he was stationed with the Air Force. She taught second grade on post and loved the community feel of the military families.
After one year in Kansas, she and her husband realized North Carolina still had their hearts and this was when Holly found Corvian. From the moment she walked through the doors, she fell in love with its philosophy, nurturing atmosphere, and community feel, as this perfectly aligns with her teaching philosophy. Throughout her four years at Corvian, she has taught 2, 3, and 5 grades, as well as served as Corvian's AIG coordinator/teacher and testing coordinator. As the AIG coordinator, she collaborated closely with administration to help launch Corvian's AIG program. She has served as a resource for teachers by providing differentiated materials to implement in the classroom. As the testing coordinator, she collaborates with the state to ensure compliance with state-mandated policies, and conducts teacher trainings for state mandated assessments.
Holly currently lives in Charlotte with her husband. She enjoys baking, exercising, crafting, and spending time with her family.        
Caroline Miller		
Director of Community Relations            
Caroline Miller graduated from the the University of South Carolina with a degree in Early Childhood Education and was awarded Outstanding Early Childhood Senior of the Year. She continued to study at USC and completed her Master of Education degree with a specialization in Language and Literacy Education. Caroline then moved to New Orleans to teach in a K-8 turnaround charter school which was one of the most “challenging, yet rewarding” years of her life. She moved back to the Carolinas to teach grades 2-4 in a CMS school. Believing in the importance of a strong classroom community and family support, Caroline initiated the first loop at her school to continue to teach the same students and deepen partnerships with families for an additional year. She taught the third grade inclusion class and was selected as the Teacher of the Year by her colleagues her final year in CMS. 
Corvian’s development of the whole child in addition to its health and wellness philosophy is what attracted Caroline to Corvian. The first time she walked in the school she knew this is what school should be like because of the art in the hallways, music in the classrooms, and students’ smiling faces. This belief remained constant as Caroline taught for three years at the elementary campus before stepping into her new role as Director of Community Relations. She intends to continue to cultivate relationships within the Corvian family and increase awareness of the magic happening within the school.
