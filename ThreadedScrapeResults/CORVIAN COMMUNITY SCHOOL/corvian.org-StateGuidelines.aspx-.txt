State Testing		
At the beginning of the school year, Corvian third graders participate in the NC Beginning of Grade (BOG) testing. Corvian students also take End-of-Grade (EOG) tests beginning in Grade 3. While we acknowledge the reality of standardized test-taking, we do not teach to the test. Rather, we engage the students in meaningful hands-on experiences linked directly to the curriculum.
At the end of each test-taking year, students participate in a thematic study focusing on how to successfully and confidently take a test. During this 6-week period, students are engaged in test-taking strategies that encompass a variety of skills. Through the use of mini lessons, workshops, small-groups, partner activities, songs, games, and brain gym activities, students become more confident in their ability to be successful on the big days.
