Strategic & Operational Priorities and Goals		
The Strategic & Operational Priorities and Goals: 2015-2018 is a “living” document.  As we continue to build our learning community, there will likely be a need to amend certain goals and priorities.  Change is a natural and positive element of this process.  As we make adjustments, we will update the document (and community) in a thoughtful and timely manner.  Throughout any modifications to our goals and priorities over the next 3 years, our mission, vision, values, and Portrait of a Graduate will be our compass.
