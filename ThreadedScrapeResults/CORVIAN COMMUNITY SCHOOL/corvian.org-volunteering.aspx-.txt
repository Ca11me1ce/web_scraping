Volunteering		
Before volunteering, we require each individual to attend volunteer training and to undergo a criminal background check.  You will also be required to check in at the front desk and to provide a driver's license for our Identa-kid check in system.
 Please complete the volunteer consent form before signing up to volunteer. 
Volunteering in your child's school is a wonderful way to show them that you value their education and that it is an important part of their lives.  As a volunteer, you will also be able to keep up with what happens day-to-day at the school and to feel more a part of the Corvian Community.  We welcome you to volunteer by any means that fit in with your schedule.
