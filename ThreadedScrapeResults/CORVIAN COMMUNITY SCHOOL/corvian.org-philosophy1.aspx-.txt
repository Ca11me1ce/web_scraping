Mission and Vision		
Corvian Community School develops the whole child and seeks to address the cognitive, emotional, social and physical needs of each student. The ultimate goal is to help students develop happy, healthy lives well-equipped for the future. 
Corvian Community School believes that every child can and will succeed in ways that reflect his or her own aptitudes, interests, and healthful lifestyle practices. Our mission is to implement the principles of Dr. Ernest Boyer’s Basic School philosophy in order to provide an optimal learning environment in which:
Teachers and parents work together to create an inclusive community of learning
Students are intrinsically motivated as lifelong learners through hands-on teaching and an integrated curriculum
Students are encouraged to develop healthy lifestyle practices for social, emotional and physical health
Teachers are empowered to meet the needs of students on an individual basis
Health and Wellness            
Our Health and Wellness Focus: 
Corvian Community School is committed to the physical, emotional, and mental health of all of its students. 
By specifically teaching the Common Core standards within our curriculum, our hope is for students to become young adults who make healthy choices for their lives. In addition, teachers will model and teach children about healthy diets and the importance of exercise and good health habits. Attention is given to teaching children about healthy food choices, and to that end, parents are encouraged to pack healthy snacks and healthy lunches each day that include fruits, vegetables, and a good source of protein. 
Tennis shoes will be required for all students on a daily basis. Students will exercise each day during outside pl
ay and physical education classes. Parents are also encouraged to provide outside play in the afternoons and on weekends. 
Physical Fitness
Physical Fitness can improve student outcomes and build better brains. 
Students will have daily opportunities for exercise (indoor and outdoor) through classroom activity, outside play, and physical education classes. 
Students begin to develop space and body awareness and are engaged in activities that develop basic levels of strength, endurance, and flexibility. 
Our Grounded Yoga program:
Corvian Community School finds the physical, emotional, academic, and interpersonal benefits that Grounded Yoga brings to our school for our students each week. The Grounded Yoga program is specifically designed for public schools and taught by Grounded Yoga Teachers. Students will find an increase in strength, flexibility, self control, and awareness. Students also learn how to recognize and cope with emotions in a healthy and productive way.
