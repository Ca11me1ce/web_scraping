Welcome to Gillingham
We at Gillingham Charter School offer K-12th grade students a unique tuition-free public education in a small learning environment designed to maximize children’s innate desire to learn and live fully. We want to be a school where students and teachers don’t have to go to, but WANT to go to!
Gillingham offers a Relational Education that is based on the ideas of Charlotte Mason.
This way of educating is deeply rooted in two primary principles:
CORE BELIEF:
Children are persons, thus they have the innate desire to learn and to live fully.
CORE PRACTICES:
We offer students a “banquet of learning” to put them in relationship with the vast inheritance of knowledge around them - with others, ideas, and the natural world - through rich language and real experiences.

Why Choose Us?
Students don’t come to Gillingham merely to hang out with friends, learn facts, pass a test, or to prepare for college.
Students come to feed their minds and their souls.
Here, they love to learn and they learn to live and author a full life, rich in relationships with self, others, nature, and ideas.
Here, they will find purpose for their lives.
For the children’s sake, Gillingham Charter School cultivates a respectful learning organization based upon the belief that children are, foremost, persons.
The nourishment of relationships, habits, and ideas through a Relational Education not only prepares students for future education,
but also fosters within them an avid desire for a life of learning,
enabling them to author their own lives confidently and resiliently.
