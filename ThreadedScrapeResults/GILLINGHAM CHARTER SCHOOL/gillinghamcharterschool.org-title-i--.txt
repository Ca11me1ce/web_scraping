Gillingham is a federally funded Title I school with two Title I teachers. With the federal funds we receive, we are able to provide extra instruction in math and reading to children who need it. Funds also provide classroom resources such as fraction tiles, magnetic letters, and guided reading books. These resources support each classroom and provide more learning opportunities for our children.
Title I Parent Committee
This monthly committee is headed by Title 1 teacher, Kara Stalter. The team faces issues, brainstorms ideas and implements solutions that make our school even greater.
To sign up, email Miss Stalter at
