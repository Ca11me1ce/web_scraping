Volunteer
Here at Gillingham, we offer a multitude of opportunities for our parents to take an active role through volunteering. Evening Collaboratives, scribing for exams, chaperoning for field studies, driving to events and field studies, and Saturday Service Projects are just a few of the opportunities available to our families.Â  Saturday service projects offer parents a wide variety of experience.
