Athletics
Believe it or not, not all wolves are “lone wolves.” Rather, they are curious, intelligent, loyal members of a pack. Wolves are very social, family-oriented and good at communicating with one another. That’s why we chose the WOLF as our school mascot.
We are the WOLF PACK: a group of committed, curious, intelligent, persevering, communicative teammates who work together to win and to learn!  
We believe in the power of sports and teams because it instills resilience, teamwork, self-motivation, hard work, communication and perseverance. When we lose, we get up again and learn from the mistakes. When we win, we walk with pride and treat the defeated with dignity. When we let the team down, we dig deep and bring our best the next time. Failure is a lesson, not the grave. We become winners in life when we learn this lesson!
If your child is interested in any of the Wolfpack’s sports programs, please contact our Athletic Director, Coach Lenny Martin
