Welcome
Young Scholar’s Academy (YSA) is a year-round public, charter school.  We strive to provide the best educational advantages for your child and to nurture his/her self-esteem. YSA is a back-to-the-basics school, emphasizing academic learning which includes reading, language arts, mathematics, and science. At Young Scholar’s Academy, staff and parents pledge to work together to help children achieve their academic potential. YSA is both a choice and a privilege; we are strictly a “first come, first serve” educational agency and we abide by the rules and regulations of the Arizona State Board for Charter Schools and the Arizona Department of Education. We do expect that all parents and students will respect and honor the policies and procedures that have been instrumental in our record of successfully preparing students to become models of academic and personal integrity.
Our Director
Young Scholar’s Academy is the realization of the dream of our founder and director, Tonnie Smith; the desire to provide children with a quality educational experience has been the focus of her passion since YSA opened in 1994. A native to the area, Mrs. Smith attended Mohave Valley Elementary, Mohave Valley Junior High, and is a graduate of Mohave High School. Earning an academic scholarship from MHS, Mrs. Smith obtained a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Elementary Education at Arizona State University and later followed with a Master of Arts Degree through Northern Arizona University.  Committed to strong academics and a belief in the importance of athletics in a well-rounded learning experience, Mrs. Smith has devoted decades of her life to volunteering in extra-curricular youth sports and absolutely loves the D-Backs! In addition, she is active in her church and enjoys the pleasures of being a grandparent.
Our School
Our campus is situated on approximately five acres and includes a state-of-the-art gymnasium, media center, art room, and twenty-two classrooms. We offer a teacher to student ratio of 1:12, which ensures individual attention for each child. Working as a team, we challenge each child to be successful while having an enjoyable learning experience.
