At Legacy, parents are our partners.
Resources for parents and students
We want to be your partner in preparing your child to take on the world. We have found that the more involved parents are, the better we can customize their child’s educational experience. This would be a great section to bookmark, as it includes many important links, resources, and other information you will access often.
