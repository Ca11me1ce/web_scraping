 The LCAP (Local Control Accountability Plan) is a critical part of the new Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF). The LCAP is a three-year plan that describes the goals, actions, services, and expenditures to support positive student outcomes that address state and local priorities. The LCAP provides an opportunity for local educational agencies to share their stories of how, what, and why programs and services are selected to meet their local needs.
Annually, The Classical Academies engage and receive feedback from parents, employees, and community members before the school’s governing board of directors approve the plans.
