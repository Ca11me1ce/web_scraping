JumpStart Conference
The Annual JumpStart Parent Education Conference is designed to inspire, connect, and motivate parents as they kick-off the school year. The conference features a keynote address, over 60 educational break out sessions, complimentary lunch, and the opportunity to network with other parents. 
Break out sessions include a variety of topics to address the needs of K-12 students, from learning to read to preparing seniors for college. 
This event is free for all Classical Academy parents. Event details and registration will be emailed to parents in summer 2018.   Jumpstart will take place on Thursday, August 16, 2018
