What Do We Offer?
The Classical Academies seek to personalize the learning for each and every student. This is accomplished through the partnership that parents share with credentialed teachers and the academic programming we offer students. Each of our campuses offers a variety of flexible programs, including traditional in-seat, independent study, and a blend or hybrid of these programs. The following flexible options are available:
Transitional Kindergarten: Pre-kindergarten program
The Transitional Kindergarten program is for students who missed the September 1st deadline for Kindergarten.  The program offers curriculum geared towards preparing students for Kindergarten. Students have the option of attending class on campus one half-day a week.
