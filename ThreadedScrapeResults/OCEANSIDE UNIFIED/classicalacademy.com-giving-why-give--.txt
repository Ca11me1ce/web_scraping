Today’s students are tomorrow’s leaders and high-quality schools are the seeds that keep communities growing and thriving.  
Our students deserve better academic options and our future depends on it.
We have the responsibility to prepare students for success and to provide an education that equips them to think critically, communicate effectively and achieve excellence.
 We believe in giving parents the freedom to choose the best education for their child.
We believe in a personalized, high-quality education for every child. 
We believe in an efficient, accountable use of tax dollars.  
But public charter schools in the state of California are not funded at the same level as traditional public schools.
Traditional public schools typically receive 5-15% more per student and have the benefit of a facility provided for them by the state.
The funding gap created 20 years ago continues, and the inequity creates a greater burden on charter schools to produce sustainable positive outcomes with students over the long haul.
Despite the immense challenges, The Classical Academies is passionate about reinventing public education.
Our award-winning schools continue to receive state and national attention for our dynamic partnership with parents and our success with students, helping them think, communicate, and achieve.
