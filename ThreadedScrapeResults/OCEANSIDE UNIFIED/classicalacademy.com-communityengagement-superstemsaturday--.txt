Super STEM Saturday
ABOUT:
Super STEM Saturday is an annual event put on in partnership with California State University San Marcos (CSUSM).  Each year we welcome thousands of families to the beautiful campus of CSUSM to discover science, reimagine technology, create engineering, and explore math.  The next Super STEM Saturday is  on Saturday March 9, 2019 from 10:00 am-4:00 pm at CSUSM.
Build and launch a rocket, play Frisbee with a robot, or become a DNA detective.  These are just a few of the nearly 100 hands-on, interactive activities and demonstrations that engage thousands of attendees at the annual science festival: Super STEM Saturday. This is a free event and open to the public, children of all ages are invited to attend.  Super STEM Saturday closes the ten-day San Diego Festival of Science and Engineering, the largest celebration of innovation and science education in Southern California.
Held in partnership by The Classical Academies and CSUSM, Super STEM Saturday has grown into a popular North County event that draws 12,000 science enthusiasts each year.
