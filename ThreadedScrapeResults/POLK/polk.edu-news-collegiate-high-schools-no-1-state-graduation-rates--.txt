Polk State Chain of Lakes Collegiate and Lakeland Collegiate high schools rank No. 1 out of 448 public high schools in Florida for four-year graduation rates.
Gov. Rick Scott recently notified Polk State College’s charter high schools of the significant achievements, with the schools graduating 100 percent of their students on time in the 2016-2017 academic year.
“We are pleased of the continued success of our students and we are committed to delivering high-quality education that prepares our students for life after high school,” Chain of Lakes Collegiate Principal Bridget Fetter said.
This if the fifth consecutive year that the schools have graduated 100 percent of seniors on time, and it is the second year in a row that they have achieved the state’s highest ranking.
Both schools continue to see great success in many areas.
Chain of Lakes Collegiate and Lakeland Collegiate have been recognized as A-schools each year
 since becoming eligible to receive school grades in 2014-2015.
The Florida Department of Education has also designated both schools as high-performing charters, which requires receiving A grades for at least two of the last three years while also exhibiting good financial health.
“Our students, faculty, and staff work hard to pursue excellence in everything we do,” Lakeland Collegiate Principal Rick Jeffries said. “These accomplishments reflect the daily commitment of our student body and collegiate high team to make our school great.”
Polk State College operates a third charter high school, 
Lakeland Gateway to College Collegiate
, which has also been recognized for its success.
Because of differences in its charter related to its mission, Lakeland Gateway to College Collegiate does not receive a school grade from the Florida Department of Education. However, it does receive a school improvement rating, which for the 2016-2017 school year was “commendable” – the highest rating achievable. Lakeland Gateway to College Collegiate was the only school in Polk County to achieve this status.
The collegiate high schools will soon host informational sessions for students interested in attending.
Chain of Lakes Collegiate and Lakeland Collegiate high schools will hold sessions starting Jan. 30 through Feb. 15, with applications becoming available Feb. 1.

Lakeland Gateway to College Collegiate’s application and informational sessions will be available later in the school year.
