Goal: 
To increase 2018 FSA/EOC/EOY scores for all BAMS students, all teachers will show evidence of consistent collaboration/processing strategies implemented in lessons as evidenced through lesson plans, classroom observations, and increased progress monitoring data by May 2018.
Strategies:

Host Conscious Teaching in-service training by August 1, 2017. (Bolender/Carver/Sawyer)
Provide Kagan in-service training for teachers by August 1, 2017. (Bolender)
Conduct progress monitoring/goal setting data day by September 30, 2017. (Bolender/Carver/Sawyer)
Conduct unit lesson plan reviews and feedback on-going through May 2018. (Bolender)
Conduct classroom observations focused on collaboration/processing by May 2018. (2 walkthroughs, 1 informal 1st and 3rd nine weeks, 2 walkthroughs, 1 formal 2nd and 4th nine weeks) (Bolender/Carver/Sawyer)
Conduct individual progress monitoring data chats in October 2017 and January 2018 and provide strategy assistance. (Bolender/Carver/Sawyer)
Target:
4- Using data for individual students, enact on the spot collaboration/processing strategies for individual student success in all lessons.
3- Consistently demonstrate the use of appropriate collaboration/processing strategies in all lessons.
2- Recognize and recall collaboration/processing strategies as evident in all lesson plans and in classroom observations.
1-  Attend training(s) on collaboration/processing strategies.
These objectives will support the three overall goals:

2. BAMS will plan for and deliver instruction based on math Common Core/Florida Standards in order to increase student proficiency. 
3. Berkley Accelerated Middle School will increase student participation in STEM initiatives and programs in order to be College and Career Ready.
