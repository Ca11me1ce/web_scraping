Our Approach
The KIPP Difference
Equipping students for success
At KIPP, teachers, students, and families are all united around the same goal—college and choice-filled lives. Through our collective hard work and commitment, KIPP students complete college at a rate that is above the national average for all students and four times higher than students of similar socioeconomic backgrounds.
High Expectations
Clearly defined and measurable high expectations for academic achievement and conduct that creates and reinforces a culture of achievement and support. We know that every student is different and we personalize learning based on a student’s needs, skills, and interests.
Strength of Character
Success in life depends on more than academic learning. We help students foster character strengths like optimism, curiosity, and grit that will help them succed in school and beyond.
Highly Skilled Teachers & Leaders
Great schools require great teachers and school leaders. We recruit the best talent for our scholars, empower our school teams, and invest in leadership and training rather than in bureaucracy.
Safe & Structured Environments
Physical and emotional safety is needed for students to take risks and learn from their successes and their mistakes. Our schools provide a safe, structured, and nurturing environment with minimal distractions so our students love school and maximize their learning.
KIPP Through College
Our counselors and advisors support students as they prepare for and select the right colleges for their needs and interests. After high school, we help KIPP alumni navigate the social, academic, and financial challenges they might encounter while in college.
Our Mission
To equip students with the academic skills, scholarly habits, and character traits necessary to be successful in top-quality colleges and the competitive world beyond.
