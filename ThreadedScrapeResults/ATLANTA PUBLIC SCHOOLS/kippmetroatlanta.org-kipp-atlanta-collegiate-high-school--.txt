About Us

Academics
We are committed to ensuring that all of our students are academically prepared to go to and through college upon graduation. Research has shown that high school students who complete Advanced Placement (AP) coursework are significantly more likely to be successful in college. With that goal in mind, our curriculum has been designed to map towards The College Board’s AP program. This program allows students to take college-level courses in high school and, upon successful achievement on the AP exam, receive course credit at many institutions of higher learning. We have a goal that each major academic discipline has an AP target course that all students will complete prior to graduation (e.g. AP English Language, AP Statistics, AP Biology, AP US History), but we also  strive to offer a variety of elective AP courses (e.g.  AP English Language, AP Calculus AB, AP Chemistry, AP Environmental Science, AP Spanish Language, AP Microeconomics, AP World History, AP Human Geography, AP Art History, and AP Music Theory) which will further expand and enhance a student’s education and learning.
School Culture
We believe that the following components are necessary to empower students to define and develop their passions and determine their future goals:
A rigorous college-preparatory academic coursework and the support to master the material
More time in school and tutorial-based office hours
A daily, single-gender advisory that focuses on  peer support and life strategies for increased academic success
Mandatory service-learning projects where students give back to their communities by partnering with a variety of local agencies
A structured learning environment and robust annual summer orientation for new students that prepares them with the skills and habits of mind necessary to excel in their first year
Explicit instruction in problem-solving and critical thinking
A commitment to having a positive influence on the community and greater world
Core Values
Honor
Unity
Tenacity
Innovation
Humanity
School Leader
