Academics
KIPP STRIVE Academy’s academic program is based upon the Georgia Standards of Excellence, but the program is accelerated and taught rigorously to ensure that students are prepared for a college preparatory high school upon eighth-grade completion. Our school places strong emphasis on reading, writing, and critical thinking. Students are expected to provide written responses and defend their positions with evidence in all classes and we encourage students to develop multiple approaches in response to real-world challenges. We believe that the best way to prepare our students for college and careers is to ensure that they have mastery of content knowledge combined with strong academic habits and character traits that transfer across all subject areas and experiences.
School Culture
The culture of KIPP STRIVE Academy is centered upon being calm and positive. This creates an environment where scholars are treated and encouraged with love, fairness and empowerment. The school’s five main values help create and support this environment and are woven throughout everything we do. Our REACH values stand for respect, enthusiasm, achievement, citizenship, and hard work. Scholars, teachers, and parents are expected to maintain high expectations and demonstrate the “REACH” values in their classes and in their daily interactions with one another. Character education is embedded throughout our program – our students learn about the REACH values the moment they become KIPPsters and these values become deeply internalized as students progress through grade levels. Through our unique culture, students learn the importance of being not only great students, but also great people.
