Academics
The academic program of KIPP WAYS Academy is designed to challenge every scholar to achieve on or above grade level performance in all academic subjects. While scholars may enter the school below grade level in many areas, the school is prepared for the challenge of equipping scholars with the knowledge, skills, and scholarly habits necessary for success in an academically rigorous college preparatory high school. The foundation of our curriculum is based upon the Georgia Performance Standards, but is accelerated and taught rigorously to ensure that scholars are prepared for a college preparatory high school upon completion of the 8th grade at KIPP WAYS Academy. Throughout the year, the scholars spend more time in all core academic subjects, providing them with sufficient time to “fill in any holes” that may exist in their academic skills or knowledge through an “accelerated spiraling” instructional approach.
School Culture
KIPP WAYS Academy is a Team and Family that is working towards the same mission. Our culture is closely tied to our school values which are “five WAYS to success:”
Scholarship – The methods, discipline, and attainments of scholars who are engaged in the pursuits of learning.
Teamwork – Cooperative effort by the members of a group or team to achieve a common goal.
Integrity – Steadfast adherence to a strict moral code in which respect and honesty are valued.
Perseverance – The act of going on resolutely or stubbornly in spite of opposition; never giving up.
Fun -Finding pleasure in all learning opportunities and enjoying the simple things in life.
When our scholars and our staff embody and demonstrate these values, they are putting forth their best effort on all tasks (perseverance); helping their teammates along the way (teamwork); achieving significant academic gains (scholarship); while enjoying them (fun) and operating with the utmost respect and honesty (integrity). When scholars have internalized these “ways to success” and practice them on a regular basis, they are equipped with both the academic and life skills to excel in any rigorous environment.
