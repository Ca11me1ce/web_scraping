Enrollment Application
Interested families may apply by completing an online application during open enrollment.
School Choice:
Parents may apply to more than one school per application, based on grade level and school district availability.
Eligibility:
Students must be eligible to attend the local school district in order to apply to attend a KIPP school in Metro Atlanta. Seven of our schools are located within the Atlanta Public Schools district, and KIPP South Fulton Academy is located in the Fulton County School System. Applications submitted with an ineligible address will not be approved. You may confirm your eligibility for the 
Atlanta Public Schools’ attendance zone
 or 
Fulton County Schools’ attendance zone
.
Duplicate Applications:
Parents must submit one application per student. Multiple applications for the same student will be considered duplicates and discarded.
Multiple Births:
Multiple births (e.g., twins, triplets, etc.) may use one application and will be treated identically during the application, lottery, and waitlist process as long as the multiple birth students are applying to the same grade level. If multiple birth students are not applying to the same grade level, a separate application must be completed for each student.

SCHOOL OPEN HOUSES
Lottery and Waitlist
If the number of qualified applications completed for a specific school during open enrollment exceeds capacity, a lottery will be held. The lottery is a random-selection process and is held once each year. Following the lottery, families will be notified of their child’s school seat or waitlist status.
Students who are offered a seat at one of their school choices may also be waitlisted at one or more higher-preference schools. The student will need to accept or decline the offered seat. If the student accepts the offered seat, the student will be removed from all waitlists. If the student declines the seat, the student will remain on the waitlist(s) for any higher-preference school(s) until a seat becomes available.
Students who are offered a seat at their first-choice school will need to accept that seat. If the student declines the seat, the student will be removed from the seated list and will not be placed on any waitlist.
Atlanta Public Schools
The lottery for all KIPP schools within Atlanta Public Schools was held in March 2017. Applications are still being accepted and will be added to the waitlist in the order they are received. However, applications received after the lottery will not receive priority preference.
The KIPP schools within Atlanta Public Schools are KIPP WAYS Primary and Academy, KIPP STRIVE Primary and Academy, KIPP Vision Primary and Academy, and KIPP Atlanta Collegiate.
Fulton County Schools
The lottery for KIPP South Fulton Academy was held on Thursday, February 17. Applications are still being accepted and will be added to the waitlist in the order they are received. However, applications received after the lottery will not receive priority preference.
 Post-Open Enrollment Applications
After the open enrollment period closes, interested parents may still submit an enrollment application. Applications received after open enrollment will place students at the end of the waitlist based on the order received. If seats become available after the lottery, they are filled by applicants in order on the waitlist.
