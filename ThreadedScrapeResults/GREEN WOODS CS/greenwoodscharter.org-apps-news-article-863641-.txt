				4th Grade Field Trip Recap			
						Mrs. Dahms' class visited the Lower Merion Conservancy					
Mrs. Dahms' 4th graders enjoyed some outdoor learning as they visited the Lower Merion Conservancy.  Students tested water from the Schuylkill River, dissected fish, and learned about how dams work.  A great time was had by all as we learned together and enjoyed the beautiful spring weather.
