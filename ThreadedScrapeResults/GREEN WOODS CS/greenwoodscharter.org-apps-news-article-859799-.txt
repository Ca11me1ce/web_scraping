				GWCS Celebrates Earth Day			
						Our students clean up!					
Green Woods Students celebrated Earth Day last Friday by working to clean up their community. All students, grades K-8, participated in a spring clean up throughout Roxborough. During the day, we were stopped by random Roxbroughians--many of whom thanked us for our helping to clean up the community!  State Rep. Pam DeLisso even stopped by for an awesome unannounced photo op! In addition, Cook-Wissahickon, Roxborough Christian School, and Roxborough High School all participated by cleaning up or planting in the Wissahickon, and Gorgas Park. It was truly amazing to have over 1000 kids participate.
Thank you to the  Streets Department, CLIP, Stanley's, Philly Folk Song Society, and Mr. Young for donating brooms, rakes, grabbers, gloves, and bags. A special thank you to Mr. Tom, Mr. Steve, and Peachy Clean who helped out big time by picking up a ton of supplies!
Here are some shots of some of our middle school students working to make an impact by protecting our environment.
