More than any other time, the topic of public education in Philadelphia is a serious conversation.  Everyone is involved in the dialogue – students, parents, families, community and business leaders, elected officials and the media.  At the very heart of this subject is the focus on quality schools:  schools that are safe and financially stable, schools that offer families a real choice, schools that strive for academic excellence and a holistic educational experience, and schools that help all students on their path toward a future of higher learning and career readiness.
