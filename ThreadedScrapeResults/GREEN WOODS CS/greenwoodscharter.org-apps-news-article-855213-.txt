				Miles for Marlee Rae Walk-A-Thon was a Huge Success!			
						We are proud to announce that our students raised over $10,000!					
Our inaugural “Miles for Marlee Rae” Walk-A-Thon was a HUGE success! The sun was shining and the kids were enthusiastic. This event really brought the school community together as a family.  
We all should be proud, our students raised over $10,000!!! We are keeping Marlee’s Mission alive by helping to raise awareness and fight childhood cancer.
Thank you to everyone that donated, volunteered, and supported this event.  A big thank you to the event chairs, Andrea DiGiovanni and Kim Ferraro. Also, a big thanks to the DJ, Neek Nyce, for keeping the energy alive throughout the day!
