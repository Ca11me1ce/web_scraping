Admissions
The application process for the 2018-2019 school year is now closed.  We are no longer accepting applications. Results of the lottery which took place on January 24, 2018 can be accessed on the menu to the right.  The results include every application received for each grade.  Seeing your confirmation number on a particular list does not indicate enrollment.  All questions regarding the lottery and enrollment process should be directed to 
registrar@greenwoodscharter.
org
NOTE: APPLICANTS MUST TURN 5 YEARS OF AGE ON OR BEFORE SEPTEMBER 1, 2018 TO APPLY FOR KINDERGARTEN. APPLICANTS MUST TURN 6 YEARS OF AGE ON OR BEFORE SEPTEMBER 1, 2018 TO APPLY FOR GRADE 1. PROOF OF BIRTH DATE AND PROOF OF RESIDENCY ARE TWO DOCUMENTS THAT WILL BE REQUIRED FOR ENROLLMENT. 
Admissions Process at a Glance for the 2018-2019 School Year: 
The following timeline will help you keep up with deadlines relevant to the Admissions process:
November 13, 2017 through January 14, 2018 - The application process opens. During this timeframe, anyone can access the application from the main page of our website at 
www.greenwoodscharter.org
. If you need assistance, please contact our registrar at: 
registrar@greenwoodscharter.org
 or (215) 482-6337 and ask for the registrar.
November 11, 2017 - Open House information sessions for prospective families. Please see the main page of our website and sign up to attend. Kindergarten Open House is 9AM. Open House for grades 1-6 is 11AM.
January 24, 2018 6:00PM - The public lottery will be held in the school cafeteria. The lottery list will be generated randomly from the list of applicants. The lottery list will be posted on the website. Applicants can, then, check their confirmation number against the lottery results to learn of their place on the waiting list. Siblings have preference. SEE "NOTE" BELOW. Applicants are welcome to attend the public lottery but it is not required. 
February 2018 - April 2018 - Enrollment will be offered to fill only those seats known to be open. Families will be contacted and required to confirm, in writing, by a certain date, that they accept the seat being offered. Families are responsible for updating personal contact information with the school. Those who accept the seat will be given forms that are required to be filled out as the next step in the enrollment process. Deadlines for completing these required forms will be communicated. If required forms are not received by the deadline, enrollment will be offered to the next family on the waiting list.
May 2018 - Final retention numbers (if any) for currently-seated students will be established and additional available seats (if any) will be confirmed.
* Only after Green Woods receives all required documents is a child's enrollment complete. If all legally required documents are not received by the required date, the family of the applicant will be notified that their child has not been successfully enrolled and we will go to the next applicant on the waitlist.
If additional seats open up, those on the waiting list will be notified.
