Bus Transportation
Sheboygan students:
We provide busing as a convenience to families that do not live close or that have transportation challenges in getting their children to school and home each day.  Bus service is provided by Prigge Bus Co. Prior to the beginning of school, bus routes are established for each family. Each family will receive a letter from the SASD regarding their bus schedule. If you have busing problems (schedules or routes), please contact Prigge’s office at 459-2961 for assistance. Busing is available for the beginning and end of day. There is no mid-day busing. Morning 4K students can ride the bus to school but must be picked up at 11 a.m. Afternoon 4K students may ride the bus home at 3:15 p.m. but must be dropped off at 12:15 p.m. Pick up and drop off information can be accessed by clicking here: 
Route Times
All other district students:
Busing is available only for in-district transportation. Students who live outside of the District can request busing for drop-off or pick-up as long as it is within Sheboygan Area School District and a bus stop already exists.
