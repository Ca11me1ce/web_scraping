Employment at LCA
Lake Country Academy has experienced significant growth in student population each year since the school began in 2001. With that growth, many new opportunities exist each year for teachers and support staff. Please check the website for any openings.
Since Direct Instruction is a pillar of Lake Country Academy, all teaching staff attend 40 hours of DI training before they are placed in a classroom. The training is done on-site and held 2-3 times each year. Professionals interested in substitute teaching should 
contact the school office
. All substitutes must attend the training as well.
