Staff List
												Family Advisory Council									
Mission
The mission of the Family Advisory Council (FAC) is to help make students and their families the center of the school. The FAC serves to increase communication between families and staff and to help raise student achievement.
YWLCS organizes a number of programs throughout the school year in which students' families are invited to come to the school. At these events, families get to meet the faculty and staff, get to know other YWLCS students and their families, and learn about the exciting learning that is going on. Some of these programs have included the Annual Student Convocation, Family Barbecue, Student Arts Coffeehouse and a Family Holiday Potluck.
How does the FAC work?
The FAC is made up of a core group of parents/guardians, staff, and chairs of the committees. The FAC is open to all parents and families interested in shaping the ways in which parents can and should be involved in the educational process at YWLCS. Officer elections will be held in the fall.
Mark your Calendar!
Any parent/guardian is invited to come to the following FAC meetings, all of which are held every month and are located at YWLCS.
If you would like to learn more about serving on the FAC, please contact Sylvia Durham by
