1. How can I become a YWLCS Student?
YWLCS is a non-selective, public charter school and is open to all young women entering grades 9-12 and living in the city of Chicago. For the 2015-16 application and detailed step-by-step application procedure, please visit our
 Admissions
 page. 
2. What is it like to be a YWLCS student?
Students at YWLCS range from grades 9-12 and come from more than 30 zip codes across Chicago. Most students come from neighborhood schools and apply to YWLCS because they are looking for one-on-one attention and the added programs that come from a small school experience. Many students remark that going to a single sex school is less distracting, builds their confidence, and gives them many opportunities for leadership. To learn about YWLCS through our students' perspective.
3. What programs and after school activities are available to YWLCS students?
The benefits of going to a small school like YWLCS are many, including the opportunity to participate in programs that large neighborhood schools are often unable to provide. YWLCS has a partnership with Chicago Youth Centers (CYC), an organization that offers our students after school clubs such as dance, Mixed Media Arts and Yoga to name a few.

 The YWLCS college prep program also offers college visits throughout the U.S. and the opportunity to participate in programs at universities around the country.
