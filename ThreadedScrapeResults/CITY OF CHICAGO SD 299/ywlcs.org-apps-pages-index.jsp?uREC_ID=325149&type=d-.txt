												About Us									
Founded in 1999, Young Women's Leadership Charter School (YWLCS) is the only all-girls STEM charter school in Chicago for grades 9th-12th.  With nearly 350 young women, we offer a safe, nurturing learning environment.  Any young woman residing in Chicago can apply but admission is lottery-based.  As a charter school we cannot charge tuition or administer admission tests. 
We will empower young women with the leadership skills, tools and opportunities to be leaders in a global and interconnected society.
We will engage young women in rigorous college prep, STEM-based curriculum that allows them to engage in relevant, meaningful activities that will challenge them to excel
Mission
The Young Women's Leadership Charter School of Chicago inspires urban girls to engage in rigorous college preparatory learning in a small school focused on math, science and technology that nurtures their self-confidence and challenges them to achieve.
Vision
All young women have the skills, tools and opportunities to develop as ethical leaders shaping their lives and the world.
Pledge
Today, tomorrow and every day, I pledge to be a leader by inspiring those who come after me and by making a difference in my school, my community and my world. Although we are different we stand as one, respecting each other as family. I pledge to be open-minded, positive and helpful and to rise like the Phoenix, never giving up on following my dreams.
