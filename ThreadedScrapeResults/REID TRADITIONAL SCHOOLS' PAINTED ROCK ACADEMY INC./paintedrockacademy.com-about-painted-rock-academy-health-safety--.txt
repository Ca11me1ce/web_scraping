HEALTH & SAFETY
News From the Health Office
Painted Rock Academy maintains a Health Office staffed by qualified healthcare providers, available to our students. We also provide CPR and defibrillator training to administrators, faculty and staff members.
Students are not allowed to self-medicate while on campus. If your child has an over-the-counter medication or a prescription, please allow the nurse to dispense medication through the Health Office. Thank you.
