TAKE A VIRTUAL TOUR
At Reid Traditional Schools’ Painted Rock Academy, we feel that it is important that parents and students have the opportunity to ‘walk through’ our schools and view our campuses, to see how our curriculum is taught at each level from Kindergarten to 7th and 8th grade.  We know that the choice parents make in selecting the right school with quality back-to-basics traditional education is imperative to the future success of their children.
We offer on site tours at Painted Rock Academy; however we have created this ‘virtual tour’ for parents to help facilitate the decision making process and to give you the ability to view our campus online, with your child, at your convenience.
Our ‘virtual tour’ has been praised by parents who have indicated they now have the knowledge and understanding of the value of education presented at Reid Traditional Schools and have subsequently selected Painted Rock Academy as their top choice of education for their child.
To begin, simply click on the videos below for a virtual tour and overview of Reid Traditional Schools’ Painted Rock Academy’s back-to-basics traditional curriculum from Kindergarten to 7th and 8th Grade, as well as our Special Area classes (Art, Music, Spanish, P.E., Computers and Library).
