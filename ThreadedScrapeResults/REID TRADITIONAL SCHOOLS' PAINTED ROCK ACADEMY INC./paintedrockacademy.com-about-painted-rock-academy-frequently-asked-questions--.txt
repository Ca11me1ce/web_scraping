FAQ: What are the boundaries for attending your school?
Public charter schools do not use boundaries for enrollment; you may apply to our school no matter where in Arizona you live.
FAQ: Does Painted Rock Academy supply transportation to and from school?
Painted Rock Academy does not supply transportation. Students from all parts of the valley attend Painted Rock Academy, making busing very difficult. The school is located near city bus routes. Parents unable to arrange transportation at designated times may take advantage of the before and after school programs.

ADDRESS & LOCATION
FAQ: Do Painted Rock Academy students wear uniforms?
Yes, uniforms are required at Painted Rock Academy. The uniforms are simple, modest, affordable, and available at many local stores. Polo shirts and turtlenecks in green, white, light blue, or navy blue are worn with navy blue or khaki skirts, skorts, shorts, or pants. A detailed uniform policy is printed in the student handbook or click the button below.
UNIFORM DRESS STANDARDS
FAQ: Does Painted Rock Academy have a lunch program?
Yes. Hot, nutritional lunches, complete with a salad bar, are available each day.
FAQ: Is the school financially stable?
Absolutely. Painted Rock Academy employs professionals to perform financial management services. The Board of Directors reviews financial records each month and hires an independent accountant to audit the financial records each year. Financial information is open to the public and may be viewed in the front office.
FAQ: Where do parents fit in?
All parents and guardians are automatically members of PROP, the Painted Rock Academy Organization of Parents, which coordinates many of the school’s volunteer activities. Parents are encouraged to be active participants in their child’s education. Parents may assist in classrooms as in other schools, but unlike other schools, parents have a definite voice in textbook selection, curriculum changes, and many policies and procedures.
PAINTED ROCK ORGANIZATION OF PARENTS

Yes. There are three optional extensions to the school day available. For Kindergarten students, we offer All Day Kindergarten for a fee. First and second graders may participate in the Academic Arcade.  All K-8 students may join Boulder Club, our main before and after school care program.
