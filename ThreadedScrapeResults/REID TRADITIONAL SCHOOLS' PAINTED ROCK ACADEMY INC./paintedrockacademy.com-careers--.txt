Painted Rock Academy Is A Great Place To Work
Join a winning team at Reid Traditional Schools’ Painted Rock Academy. Come and be part of a school that feels like a home. Parents, administrators, and staff appreciate the hard work of teachers. At Painted Rock Academy, we celebrate our children’s successes together.
We Take Care Of Our Teachers
Painted Rock Academy offers a competitive salary and a great benefit package. Teachers have no playground duties during the school day (before school and after-school pick-up duty only), and they have a high level of classroom support from a team of classroom aides. The Board of Directors and the parent organization shower Painted Rock Academy employees with food and gifts throughout the year.
