Lunch Order
Welcome to Painted Rock Academy’s Lunch Order program. We have a separate website to offer our students the opportunity to have hot nutritious lunches with online ordering. The price for lunch is $3.25; on pizza days, an extra slice may be added for $1.50.  Milk is available for 50 cents.
ORDER your LUNCHES HERE
ORDERING SCHEDULE: Order for the entire month, for the week, or even for one day, as long as ordering is placed by 8:00 a.m. on the day of lunch service.
 You can order in the morning until 8:00 a.m.
We encourage you to order lunches a month at a time. It’s just simpler and easier that way. You may also order daily or weekly instead.
PAYMENT INFORMATION:
The program accepts payment by debit card or credit card through Visa, MasterCard, or Discover.
Be sure to proceed to checkout and process your payment. Orders that are left in the shopping cart will NOT be processed and your student(s) will not be included in the lunch service.
After entering your card information, do not close your browser prior to receiving the confirmation display or your order may be interrupted and not fully processed. If a confirmation page is not displayed, do not attempt to enter payment again, as this may result in duplicate charges.
Ordering for more than one person? Please be sure to add all items for your students into the shopping cart 
BEFORE
 checking-out.
MINIMUM ORDER FEE:
A minimum $10.00 order is required for new or changed orders – otherwise $1.00 handling fee is charged.
PROCESSING FEE:
A nominal processing fee is charged so that we can offer our lunch program online.
NEED TO CHANGE or CANCEL YOUR ORDER?
Changes or cancellations can be made during the open ordering period. All cancellations or changes 
must be
 received by 8:00 a.m. on the day of the order. Once the ordering period has closed, your order is FINAL. Credits for cancellations will be applied to your next order.
FORGOT TO PLACE YOUR ORDER?
After 8:00 a.m.,  the ordering period has closed, and LATE ORDERS ARE NOT ACCEPTED.  Neither the front office nor boonli.com is authorized to allow any orders after the menu has closed.
CREDIT FOR A MISSED LUNCH:
Because certain ingredients are purchased in advance and menu items are cooked to order, credits cannot be given if your student misses their lunch due to illness or appointments made during lunch.
WAS THERE A MISTAKE?
If you believe there was a mistake of any kind with your order, please let us know by emailing 
support@boonli.com
 We will investigate the potential error and use all methods available to ensure the mistake is satisfied.
BE SURE TO GET EMAIL NOTIFICATIONS:
To receive notifications including ordering reminders, important communication, confirmations, and password resets:
 Make sure you have an email address in your boonli.com profile
Add “noreply@boonli.com” to your email safe senders list.
