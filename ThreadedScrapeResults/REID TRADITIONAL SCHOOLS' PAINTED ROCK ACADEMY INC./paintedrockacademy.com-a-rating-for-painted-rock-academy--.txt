“A” Rating for Painted Rock Academy

FEATURED POSTS
The Arizona Department of Education has announced preliminary letter grades for the 2016-17 school year, and, as always, Reid Traditional Schools’ Painted Rock Academy and Reid Traditional Schools’ Valley Academy both received an “A” letter grade. In our organization’s 20+-year history, our schools have never received less than the highest possible ranking.
While we are unashamedly proud of this rating, it is more important to know that an “A” represents public recognition of our success at our true mission: preparing your children for success in college, career, and life. Our teachers and administration are committed and passionate about inspiring students on a daily basis, not just on test day. Our intellectually challenging and balanced curriculum has proven to be effective in educating students for future success. So as we celebrate our “A” rating, we also celebrate our genuine commitment to our children, our schools, and our future.
Congratulations to our students, our parents, and our faculty and staff. Your effort and teamwork have been recognized once again with another “A.”
