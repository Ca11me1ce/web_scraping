Mrs. Warner was drawn to Board service by her support of the traditional values of Reid Traditional Schools’ Valley Academy and by the commitment of its employees and students’ parents. Mrs. Warner has enjoyed her many years of Board service and looks forward to watching the growth and success of Reid Traditional Schools’ Painted Rock Academy. Her years of volunteer work have expanded to include working with Crisis Nursery of Phoenix, American Cancer Society, Junior Achievement of Arizona, and Teen Reach Adventure Camp (Hope Unlimited), and hosting two foreign exchange students from Russia through Ayusa International.
