BENEFIT INFORMATION
At Reid Traditional Schools’ Painted Rock Academy, we value our employees, and our benefits package reflects that fact. Following is a summary of Painted Rock Academy’s current benefits package.
Retirement
Painted Rock Academy provides retirement and long term disability benefits through the Arizona State Retirement System. This is a valuable benefit to our employees. Only one-third of charter schools in Arizona offer ASRS retirement, and we are happy to provide this benefit to our staff. ASRS guidelines dictate eligibility and participation rates. This benefit is available to employees who regularly work over 20 hours per week. Painted Rock Academy matches 100% of employee contributions. Click the button below for more information about the State’s Retirement System.
Arizona State Retirement System
A supplemental Salary Deferral Plan is offered in conjunction with the Arizona State Retirement System through TIAA-CREF for employees who wish to have an additional way to save for retirement.  Click below for more information.

Health, Dental and Vision Insurance
Painted Rock Academy offers comprehensive medical, dental and vision coverage to full-time employees.  Employees pay only $10 per pay period for health, dental, and/or vision insurance – the school pays the bulk of the premium. Coverage for dependent spouses and children may be purchased for an additional charge.
Life Insurance
Painted Rock Academy provides $25,000 in life insurance to every employee who regularly works over 30 hours per week. Additional insurance for employees, spouses, and dependents may be purchased upon request.
AFLAC Insurance
Many additional insurance packages are available for purchase through AFLAC Insurance, including Short Term Disability, Hospitalization insurance, Cancer Coverage, and more.
