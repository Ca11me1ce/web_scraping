Who Is Eligible For Tax Credits
Individuals and couples who pay Arizona taxes may participate. You do not have to have a child enrolled in school to claim the credit. So encourage all your Arizona family and friends to support our school and get a dollar-for-dollar refund for their generosity.
It is always best to consult a tax adviser to see if you qualify for this dollar-for-dollar credit.
These donations support our school
extracurricular activities
including sports, clubs and music.
Your help means a lot to the kids,
and we all thank you for your donation. 
When To Make Tax Credit Donations
Tax Credit donations are accepted throughout the year and are usually used for the current tax year.  However, if you donate between January 1st and April 15th, you may choose to use this donation for the current year’s tax return or the prior year’s return.
How Tax Credits Work
Arizona taxpayers may write a check or make a contribution via credit card on the school website. When you file your Arizona state taxes, the amount of your contribution is subtracted from what you owe or added to the amount of your refund. For example:
If you owe $700 in Arizona state taxes and make a $400 contribution to our school, you subtract $400 from the taxes you owe – so you now owe $300.
If you are expecting a $600 refund on your Arizona state taxes and make a $400 contribution to our school, you add $400 to the amount of your refund – so your new refund will be $1,000.
Making tax credit donations is
like paying your taxes directly
to our school! 
If you were not required to pay Arizona taxes, perhaps because you did not work during the year, or were required to pay only a small amount, the tax credit can only be used to reduce your tax liability to zero. You can, however, carry any unused tax credits forward up to five years. Here’s an example of the above scenario:
You were injured and only worked a few weeks during the year, so your state tax liability was $50. You made a $200 tax credit donation. You can use $50 to pay the current year taxes, and carry over $150 in tax credits to be used next year.
Amounts Available For Tax Credits
Couples filing joint tax returns may donate any amount up to $400; individuals filing single and head of household may donate up to $200. Married taxpayers filing separately can claim up to $200 on each return. Corporations and business are not eligible for these tax credits.
Support our school and get a dollar-for-dollar
refund. There's no downside! 
We Put These Donations To Good Use
Tax credit donations are used for many things. Recently, our schools have purchased sports equipment for school teams, paid referee fees, purchased music, paid coaches, purchased games and art supplies for after school programs, purchased materials for after school clubs, and funded intramural and state-wide competition costs. With your help, we have been able to expand the extracurricular opportunities for our students, and they appreciate it.
