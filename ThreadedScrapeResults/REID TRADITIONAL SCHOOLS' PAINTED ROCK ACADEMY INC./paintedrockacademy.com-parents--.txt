PARENTS
Parents, welcome to your one-stop-shop resource section on the PRA website.  The pages under the Parents’ section provides you with helpful information, resources, tools and links to help both you and your student.   Simply hover over PARENTS in the top menu to reveal a drop down menu of additional pages available to assist you.
In addition to the Parents’ section, the top menu across the top of the website provides other pages and resources directly related to assisting you with payments, volunteering, calendars, grades, news and contacting teachers and/or staff.
Please take time to review and familiarize yourself with all of the pages and sub-pages across the top menu, as they will greatly benefit both you and your student.
Also, note that we have also provided several Quick Links in the right sidebar to help you to navigate quickly to those items that might be most helpful to you.
Third Grade Promotion and Retention Changes
There have been significant changes to Arizona Revised Statutes regarding the promotion and retention of third grade students. For more information, please contact Mr. Bauer, Painted Rock Academy Principal.
