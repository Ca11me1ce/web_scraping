BEFORE & AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS
Painted Rock Academy has programs available for:
Preschool-8th grade Students (Boulder Club)
Kindergarten Students (All Day Kindergarten)
1st and 2nd Grade Students (Academic Arcade)
BOULDER CLUB
School schedules do not always fit adult work schedules. For parents in need of extra assistance at the beginning or end of the school day, Boulder Club, a before and after school program, is available. Here students have a chance to finish homework assignments, giving families more free time at the end of a busy day. After completion of homework assignments, students may play games and participate in activities that are academic in nature. Boulder Club is a service open to students in preschool through 8th grade. Care is offered before school from 6:30 a.m. to 7:30 a.m. and after school from 3:15 p.m. to 6:15 p.m.  Sessions are also available on most Early Release days.
Morning sessions cost a daily flat rate of $3.50. Afternoon sessions cost $6.00 per hour. For families with more than one child, a 20% sibling discount is applied to the fees of the oldest child. There is no registration fee for Boulder Club. For more information about Boulder Club, please contact the school office at (623) 466-8855 or email us:

You may also refer to the Boulder Club Handbook, which includes registration forms.
BOULDER CLUB HANDBOOK
ALL DAY KINDERGARTEN
The school day for students in kindergarten ends at 11:05 a.m. Families interested in an extended day for their kindergarten child may take advantage of the full day kindergarten program. This enables students to remain on campus for the entire school day while enhancing their education with thematically based units of literature, science, social studies, art, music, and P.E. Full day kindergarten runs from 8:00 a.m. to 3:15 p.m.
Tuition for full day kindergarten is collected in ten equal installments of $200 each, with a one-time registration fee of $40. Students are registered through the school office.
ACADEMIC ARCADE
Students in first and second grade are released from school at 2:15 p.m. Grades 3 – 8 are dismissed at 3:15 p.m. First and second grade students may extend their school day for one hour with the Academic Arcade. The Arcade offers a relaxed, less structured atmosphere where learning continues in a more casual environment. Students rotate through crafts, story times, and thematic activities. Structured outdoor activities are also scheduled, giving young students a chance to burn off excess energy. Academic Arcade is open to students in first and second grades.
The fee for this program is $35 each month of the ten-month school year,  with a $40 one-time registration fee.  If your child is enrolled in Painted Rock Academy and you would like to enroll in this program, please complete two forms below.
