BOARD OF DIRECTORS
Greetings from the Board
Everyone works together to create the excellence of a Reid Traditional School such as Painted Rock Academy. We invite you to visit our board meetings, help in the classrooms, or assist our parent organization with school activities. Together we make Painted Rock Academy a great place to work and learn.
Board News
Board meetings are scheduled for the fourth Thursday of every month, unless otherwise posted.
About the Board of Directors
Reid Traditional Schools’ Painted Rock Academy, Inc. is a private non-profit corporation. The corporation holds the charter for Reid Traditional Schools’ Painted Rock Academy. The charter is a legal agreement between the corporation and the school’s sponsor to offer a specific type of public education. The corporation Board of Directors is also the Board of Directors for the school. It self-selects new members based on the Board’s needs and applicants’ dedication to preserving and protecting the school and the charter. Members of the Board of Directors are unpaid volunteers.
Each member serves a three-year term. To the extent possible, terms are staggered to maintain a balance of experience on the Board.  In accordance with Arizona law, Board members may serve for an unlimited number of terms.
Board Responsibilities
The Painted Rock Academy Board of Directors is responsible to the school’s sponsor (Arizona State Board for Charter Schools) and the charter which allows Painted Rock Academy to exist. The charter makes it clear that the Board must supply a public traditional, back-to-basics education.
The Board sets policy, approves educational programs and textbook adoption, approves the hiring and termination of personnel, sets salaries and compensation, and adopts a yearly budget. The Board is also the final step in the organization’s due process for employees, students and their families, and other stakeholders.
The responsibility to oversee and administer programs and policies rests with the Chief Executive Officer, who is hired and supervised by the Board. The CEO hires and supervises the Principal.
Board Action
The advice of the public (primarily client parents and guardians) and employees is given careful consideration before action is taken on any item. The Board’s first concerns are for the educational program as it affects students, the charter, and compliance with all applicable state and federal regulations. Final decisions may depart from the advice of the public when, in the judgment of the Board, such advice is not consistent with the charter, the school’s focus and goals, or within reach of available financial resources.
Board Meetings
Regular meetings of the Governing Board are usually held on the fourth Thursday of each month. However changes are made to avoid holidays and when quorum is unavailable. Special meetings are called as needed, usually to meet compliance with applicable regulations or to facilitate efficient business operations. The board may occasionally adjourn into Executive Session, which is a private meeting closed to the public, only under certain circumstances as prescribed by law. All meetings except Executive Sessions are open to the public, and everyone is encouraged to attend.
Pursuant to A.R.S. §38-431.02, Painted Rock Academy hereby states that all notices of the meetings of the Painted Rock Academy Board of Directors will be posted in the front office of the school and on our website. The office is open to the public Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. during the school year and Monday through Thursday in the summer. These notices will indicate the date, time, and place of the meeting. Members of the public may obtain an agenda for the meeting in the front office.
