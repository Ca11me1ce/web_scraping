Welcome Back for 2017-2018!!!
I am extremely excited for the new year and all that it will bring.  First and foremost, I would like to share that we are again splitting one of our combination classrooms, the 5th/6th grades room.  A new classroom building will be installed in September, and I would like to welcome Mr. Bylow as our new 5th grade teacher to add to our amazing teachers who are all returning for 2017-2018!  I am also pleased to share that for the first time we have elected not to contract with SCOE for our Resource Specialist and have hired Mrs. Ellis to be our own specialist working to provide extra services to our students.  We will also be adding new carpets to the main building and staff room along with resurfacing the blacktop.  New mathematics instructional materials have been purchased and we will once again use i-Ready.  A new laptop cart has been purchased for our 5th graders and the district server is being replaced after eight years to hopefully avoid any issues.  We have also contracted with Highlands Energy to upgrade approximately $100,000 worth of equipment to improve our energy efficiency with upgraded lighting, HVAC units.  This project looks to take place over Winter Break.  Our student athletes can also look forward to new athletic uniforms for the 2017-2018 school year.  I can't wait to see everyone back ready to work hard, learn new things and enjoy some great experiences together!
