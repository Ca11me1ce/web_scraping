Interview Tips
	Tips for strengthening your application
	Resume
	This is your first impression and is the key to ensuring you continue in the selection process. Help your resume stand out by following these tips:
		Make your resume look professional. Your resume should be neatly organized and easy to read.	
		Be concise (less than two pages).	
		Highlight your accomplishments. For educators, this can include standardized test results, leadership roles, awards received, extracurricular activities supported, or programs developed.	
		Ensure your contact information is updated.	
		Edit, edit, edit! Read and re-read your resume for formatting, spelling and grammatical errors, and consistency. Having others read over your resume is always a good idea.	
	Online Interview
	While following the resume tips above does not guarantee you receive an online interview, it will certainly increase your chances. Here are some tips to ace your online interview:
		Be familiar with KIPP Houston Public Schools. Take some time to learn more about our organization at our 
KIPP Houston Public Schools
 and 
KIPP
 websites. You can also check out our 
Facebook
 and 
LinkedIn
 pages and follow us on 
Twitter
 and 
Instagram
.	
		The beauty of the online interview is that it is scheduled at your convenience! You know yourself best. If you are tired or stressed at the end of the day, you may want to consider completing your interview in the morning.	
		Ensure that you can complete the entire interview in a quiet location without interruptions or loss of internet connection.
