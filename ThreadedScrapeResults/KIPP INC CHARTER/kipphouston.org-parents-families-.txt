	About
	Founded in Houston in 1994, the Knowledge Is Power Program (KIPP) is committed to providing historically underserved communities with a college-preparatory education that prepares them to succeed in college and in life. In Houston, there are more than 14,500 KIPP students enrolled in 28 KIPP schools. 
	FAQs
	What is KIPP?
	The Knowledge Is Power Program (KIPP) is a non-profit network of college-preparatory, public charter schools serving elementary, middle, and high school students. We have a 24-year track record of preparing our students in underserved communities for success in college and life. 
	What is a public charter school?
	The term public charter school means that the state has granted a contract to a group or organization to run a school using state funds. The school offers innovative learning opportunities with greater flexibility than traditional public schools and is accountable to the charter holder. In KIPP Houston’s case, the Texas Education Agency is the charter authorizer. Charter school students are eligible for the same state and federal programs (including free or reduced meals) that are available in other school districts.
	What makes KIPP different?
	At KIPP, teachers, students, and families are all united around the same goal—college graduation. Through our collective hard work and commitment, KIPP students complete college at a rate that is above the national average for all students and four times higher than students of similar economic backgrounds. Our success is driven by:
		High Expectations: KIPP has clearly defined and measurable high expectations for academic achievement and conduct that creates and reinforces a culture of achievement and support.	
		Strength of Character: Success in life depends on more than academic learning. We help students foster character strengths that are essential for their own success. We empower our students to express their voice with power and to improve the world around them. 	
		Highly-Skilled Teachers and Leaders: Great schools require great teachers and school leaders. We empower our school teams and invest in leadership and training.  	
		Safe & Structured Environments: Physical and emotional safety is needed for students to take risks and learn from their successes and their mistakes. Our schools provide a safe, structured, and nurturing environment with minimal distractions so our students love school and maximize their learning.	
		KIPP Through College: Our counselors and advisors support students as they prepare for and select the right college for their needs and interests. After high school, we help KIPP alumni navigate the social, academic, and financial challenges they might encounter while in college and life.	
	How do I enroll my child in a KIPP school?
	KIPP Houston schools are open-enrollment, public schools.

	What is KIPP’s commitment to excellence?
	KIPP is a partnership among parents, students, and teachers that puts learning first. All three parties sign a learning pledge called the "Commitment to Excellence," which ensures that each will continually commit to building a better tomorrow to help the student learn.
	Does KIPP offer fine arts and athletics?
	Although options vary by KIPP school, KIPP does offer a wide variety of fine arts and athletics. Please contact a KIPP school near you for more information.
