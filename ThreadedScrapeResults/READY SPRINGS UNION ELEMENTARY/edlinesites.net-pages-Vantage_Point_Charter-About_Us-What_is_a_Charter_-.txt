What is a Charter?
A charter school is a public school of choice. Enrollment is open to all students, both within and outside the school district. No tuition is charged. Funding is provided through the state, just as it is in traditional public schools. There are no academic entrance requirements. Charter schools were created to provide more choices in public education. They operate without the constraints of traditional public schools, giving them the freedom to enroll out-of-district students and to develop a program designed specifically to execute the school’s academic mission.
Many parents are seeking alternatives to the public education available in their district of residence.  You may feel your children are capable of higher levels of academic achievement, but the necessary opportunities are not available.  Perhaps you are looking for more individualized attention within a safe and nurturing environment where your children can learn social responsibility, self-discipline, and respect for others.  Vantage Point Charter School has built a program that may be just what you are looking for.  By adding a charter school, we are able to enroll students without an inter-district transfer from contiguous counties.    This opens our doors to families we may not otherwise be able to serve.
