Educational Beliefs and Goals
Educational Beliefs and Goals
Educational Program Beliefs
Parents are an integral part of a student’s education
Instructional activities are integrated, meaningful, and related to life outside of the classroom
Curriculum is individualized to meet student’s needs so that different modalities/styles are acknowledged and addressed
Students are encouraged to master academic skills to the best of their ability
Students have the opportunity to go beyond grade level expectations
There is an understanding of the importance of both process and product
Instructional activities inspire enthusiasm and interest in the subject
Educational Program Goals
Students will be encouraged to be self-motivated and life-long learners, primarily through self-directed opportunities pursued by the student and facilitated by Vantage Point Charter staff, with the support of parents.  This sense of ownership naturally elicits enthusiasm, interest and involvement.  
Vantage Point Charter students will perform and achieve as well as or better than students in the district’s traditional school.
Knowledge and demonstration of integrated learning across major subject areas will be evaluated through assessment tools.
