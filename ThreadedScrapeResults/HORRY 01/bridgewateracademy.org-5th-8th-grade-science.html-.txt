Welcome to Middle School Science!
My name is Mrs. Renee, and I’ve had the privilege of being a part of Bridgewater Academy since 2014 as the Middle School Science Teacher.  Over those four years, we’ve experienced great things in and out of the classroom. From dissecting frogs, fetal pigs, and sheep’s eyes to hosting our annual Science Fair, we’ve covered it all.
​
​When I’m not at Bridgewater Academy, I enjoy spending time with my husband, Terrell, and our beautiful little girl, Madelynn Ava.
​
I truly enjoy being a part of the Bridgewater Academy family and I look forward to learning and growing, this year, with my students!
Sincerely,
​Mrs. Renee
