Things you'll want to see!
Welcome to Mr. D's Social Studies Class!
I'm Mr. D., the Middle Grades Social Study Teacher at Bridgewater Academy.
I may be new to Bridgewater Academy, but I'm not new to Myrtle Beach and I'm not new to education!  I was born and raised in Conway and spent my summers helping my grandparents on their farm. I attended Conway area schools and attended college at Coastal Carolina University, attaining a Bachelor's Degree in Sociology.
Over the years I've had a lot of life experience, which I love to bring into the classroom. Most recently, I spent three years working for Waccamaw Publishers, reporting on news around Horry County for the Myrtle Beach Herald, Carolina Forest Chronicle, Horry Independent and Loris Scene.
This year is my first year as a full-time teacher at Bridgewater. I have also been a special education paraprofessional and a substitute teacher with Horry County Schools and I love working with students with a variety of strengths and abilities.
I'm a huge fan of Star Wars, Marvel superheroes, Star Trek, and the writings of C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien. I'm an avid photographer and outdoorsman and I love to learn anything I can about history or science.
​I'm a nerd and proud of it!
​I hope you enjoy this little piece of our classroom!
There is no try. Do, or do not.
-Yoda
You don't have to burn books to destroy a culture. Just get people to stop reading.
​-Ray Bradbury
If your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, you are a leader.
-John Quincy Adams
In light of my past experience, my present circumstances, and my future hopes and dreams, what is the wise thing to do?
​-Andy Stanley
Insufficient facts always invite danger.
-Mr. Spock
All that is gold does not glitter,
Not all those who wander are lost;
The old that is strong does not wither,
Deep roots are not reached by the frost.
-J.R.R. Tolkien, "The Fellowship Of The Ring"
