Students with Disabilities Notice
Students with Disabilities in Charter Schools:
Notice of Rights to Access and Equity of EducationalServices
Dear Parent:
This document explains the educational rights of students with disabilities toattend Massachusetts charter schools and to receive appropriate specialeducation services in those charter schools. Both federal and state lawrequires that admission to a charter school be conducted without regard to orconsideration of whether the child has a disability, and so charter schools areopen to all students, whether or not they are eligible to receive specialeducation services. Charter schools must provide special education services, upto the limits specified under the state charter school law, to all eligiblestudents. This is a summary of your student’s rights to attend and receiveneeded services from his or her charter school. 
¨
Charter schools accept and serve students with disabilities.
Charter schools are open toall grade-eligible students within the school’s service area on a spaceavailable basis. If more students apply than there are available spaces, alottery is held to randomly determine who will be admitted. All students whowish to attend a charter school have an equal chance of getting in regardless of,and without any consideration of, any need for special education services. 
See: M.G.L. c. 71 §89 (l)states that charter schools shall be open to all students, on a space availablebasis, and shall not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin,creed, sex, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, mental or physical disability, age,ancestry, athletic performance, specialneed, or proficiency in the English language or a foreign language, andacademic achievement. (Emphasis added)
¨
Charter schools must ensure that your studentreceives special education services if the student has been determined to be aneligible student with a disability by the Individualized Education Program(IEP) team.
Charter schools must ensurethat students with disabilities receive the special education services to whichthey are entitled. The services may consist of special education instructionand related services in the least restrictive environment, or consist only ofrelated services needed to access the general education curriculum. The amountand location of services (where services will be delivered) is determined bythe student’s IEP team and is documented in the student’s IEP. As determined byyour student’s IEP team, your charter school will provide services in aplacement that is: 
Full inclusion- the student is in the general     education classroom for 80%-100% of the school day; or
Partial inclusion- the student is in the general     education classroom 40-80% of the school day; or
Substantially separate- the student is out of the     general education classroom more than 60% of the school day. 
¨
Your student must receive related services if theIEP team determines the student needs them.
Charter schools must providerelated services to students with disabilities if the IEP team determines thatthe services are necessary for the student to benefit from special educationor, if the student does not require special education instruction, that therelated services are necessary to ensure the student’s access to the generaleducation curriculum. Examples of these services include: speech therapy,occupational therapy, physical therapy, psychological counseling, and/oradjustment counseling. 
¨
Charter schools arerequired to meet the needs of qualified students with disabilities underSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, even if the studentis not eligible as a student with disabilities under federal and state specialeducation laws.
Charter schools are requiredto provide a free appropriate public education to qualified students withdisabilities under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended.Such education consists of general education accommodations and related aidsand services designed to meet the individual educational needs of students withdisabilities as adequately as the needs of students without disabilities aremet. An appropriate education for a student with a disability under Section 504regulations could consist of education in general education classrooms withaccommodations, education in general education classes with supplementaryservices, and/or related services. Schools would include these services in a“504 Plan.”  
¨
Forstudents who may require special education services that are beyond what thecharter school is required to provide, an IEP team meeting will be convened toarrange for provision of needed services.
If the IEP team convened bythe charter school believes that your student may require a full-time day orresidential special education program, the charter school will convene aseparate placement meeting to determine the appropriate placement. You will beinvited to the meeting, as will the school district of the town where youreside. When the meeting occurs, the placement team must first consider whetherthe school district of residence has an in-district program that is able toprovide the services that are recommended by the IEP team, either alone or as asupplement to services available at the charter school. If there is suchin-district programming available, the placement team must propose anin-district program to the parent (which may be delivered in the charter schoolitself, through a program located in the school district of residence or acombination of both), the student will remain enrolled in the charter school,and the charter school retains programmatic and financial responsibility forthe student. Please note that the charter school has full discretion over whereit will propose to deliver any in-district programming, and is notrequired to contract with the school district of residence forservice delivery unless the charter school chooses to do so.
If the placement team,including the school district of residence, agrees that the student cannot beserved in-district, then the placement team shall determine that the studentrequires an out-of-district placement, in which case the student’s enrollmentand responsibility for the student’s special education program reverts to theschool district of residence. 
Because enrollment at thecharter school is always voluntary on the part of the parent, the parent mayelect to disenroll from the charter school and enroll, instead, back at theschool district of residence or another school for any reason and at any time.However, the charter school may not require the parent to disenroll as acondition for receiving any service, except when the student’s specialeducation placement has been determined, as above, to be an out-of-districtprogram.
