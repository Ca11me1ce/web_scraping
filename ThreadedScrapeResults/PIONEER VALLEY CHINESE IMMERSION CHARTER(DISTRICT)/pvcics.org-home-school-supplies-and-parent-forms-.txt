School Supplies, Forms and Documents
2017-2018 School Year
Please see the folders below for school supplies lists, forms and informational documents for parents. 
Some notes: 
School Supplies
PVCICS has purchased school supplies in bulk for grades K-5 so parents don't need to buy these but pl
ease help us cover costs by 
a voluntary donation to our school supplies fund. It'll help pay for all the paper, markers, pencils, books and materials the students use.
For grades 6-12, parents/guardians should purchase supplies for their child's grade and the school supply lists are below.
