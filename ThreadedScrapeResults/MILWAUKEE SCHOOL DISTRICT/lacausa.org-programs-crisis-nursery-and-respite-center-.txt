Who We Are
La Causa Crisis Nursery & Respite Center
La Causa Inc.'s Crisis Nursery & Respite Center serves as a long-standing safe haven for the community. For over 25 years, we have provided the most basic needs - clothing, food, and shelter to our communities youngest and most vulnerable members of society – our children.
Open 24 hours a day/365 days a year, we provide support to children age birth to 12 years old when family emergencies arise, such as homelessness, domestic violence, medical needs or more -- Like when a mom has post pregnancy complications and needs to go back into the hospital -- her newborn is safe and sound with us.
The Crisis Nursery & Respite Center is the only state licensed center of its kind in southeast Wisconsin. We care for up to 12 children each night, and children can stay for up to 72 hours at no cost to the family. We are a resource in the community helping families avoid exposure to traumatic, crisis situations that could leave long-lasting, detrimental effects on a child’s emotional, mental and/or physical well-being.
