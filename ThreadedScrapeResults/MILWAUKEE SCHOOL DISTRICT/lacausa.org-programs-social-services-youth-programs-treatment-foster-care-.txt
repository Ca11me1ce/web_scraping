Treatment foster care is 24-hour care provided by licensed foster parents for children who cannot live with their parents due to unsafe, or other circumstances. Generally, placement in foster care is temporary and intended to give the child's family time to make necessary changes, so that the child can live safely in his or her home. Most children in foster care return home to their families. When children cannot return home, they find placement with relatives, adoption, or other alternatives. Our program serves children between birth to 18 years of age.
What sets La Causa, Inc. apart from other agencies that provide foster care services in the community? We have a dedicated team of Treatment Foster Care Specialists who provide individual, family centered resources and care throughout the foster care process. Please complete an inquiry form to speak with one of our licensing specialists.
Foster Parents
Becoming a licensed foster parent is a multi-step process that can take up to four months. Successful foster parents come from a variety of backgrounds – they are all different ages, races, income levels, and occupations. They have two things in common: they have a desire to help children, and they are flexible. Foster parents can be single or married, own their own homes or rent apartments, work in or outside of their homes. Many foster families already have children, but some are caring for children for the first time. The most important part of being a foster parent is providing a safe, stable home to care for children.

Licensing Options:
Treatment Foster Care  
Treatment foster care is home-based care for children birth to 18 years old who have experienced trauma or abuse. These children may experience moderate to severe emotional, behavioral, physical or mental challenges.
Safe Home
The Safe Home program supports girls ages 13 – 18 who are at high risk of or have been sexually exploited. One foster parent is required to stay at home and provide full time care for the youth, generally between 30 – 60 days. Foster parents receive a monthly stipend for their service. 
Professional Foster Parent Program
For girls between the ages of 13-18 who exhibit high risk behaviors.  One foster parent is required to stay at home to care for the youth full-time while also providing Wraparound Care Coordination for the youth and their family.  The foster parent is paid a monthly stipend for both the Care Coordination piece as well as the requirement of staying at home.   
Respite Care
Respite care is short-term, temporary child care that gives foster parents a break, usually on the weekends or during emergency situations. Respite care providers must be at least 18 years of age, meet home and sleeping requirement if a child stays overnight, and pass criminal and caregiver background checks.
