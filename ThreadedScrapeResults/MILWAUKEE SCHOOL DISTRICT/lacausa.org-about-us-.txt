Why We Exist
When we first opened our doors in 1972, we were the first bilingual day care center serving the Hispanic population – today, the impact we make on the community, especially the Hispanic community, is much greater:
La Causa Charter School serves nearly 800 elementary and middle school students in K4 through 8th grade. Located on Milwaukee’s Southside in an ethnically diverse neighborhood, La Causa Charter School offers bilingual learning in an innovative, multicultural environment. Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math (STEAM) are an important part of our curriculum.
La Causa’s Early Education and Care Center supports infants and toddlers (ages 4 weeks to 24 months), early preschool (age 2), and Three and Ready (ages 3 and 4). Children (up to age 12) attend the before and after school care and summer programs. We are proud to have earned a Five-Stars rating in Wisconsin’s YoungStar Program; and are fully accredited by the National Accreditation Commission (NAC) for Early Care and Education.
La Causa’s Crisis Nursery and Respite Center keeps children safe and out of harm’s way. We are a resource for child abuse prevention and other crisis situations that could have long-lasting, detrimental effects on a child’s emotional, mental and/or physical well-being.
La Causa’s Social Services Adult Programs provides an array of services to support adults with mental health assessment, recovery support services, and assistance with drug or alcohol abuse. In some cases the support recovery includes a Peer Specialist, someone who can provide first-hand experience, to inspire and empower individuals who are on the road to recovery.
La Causa’s Social Services Youth Programs focuses on providing services that improve a family’s quality of life, such as wrap around services, treatment foster care, and teen pregnancy and prevention.
La Causa’s Support Services provides the foundation of professional and administrative support, such as accounting, finance, fund development, grants, human resources, information technologies, and marketing to support all divisions and programs.
