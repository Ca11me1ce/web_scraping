Early Education and Care Center 
Who We Are
La Causa, Inc.’s Early Education and Care Center provides services to children age 4 weeks through 3 years old in our child care programs. Children ages 4 weeks through 12 years old can participate in our before and after school program, as well as our summer programs. We offer bilingual classrooms and a creative learning environment. We are open Monday through Friday from 5:30 am to 6:00 pm.
We are fully accredited by the National Accreditation Commission for Early Education and Care; and we have been awarded the Five-Star YoungStar rating by the State of Wisconsin’s Child Care Quality Rating and Improvement System.
We offer our families:
Bilingual classrooms – While strengthening a child’s primary language is our first priority, our classrooms simultaneously introduce a second language during play and in conversation.
Every classroom is structured upon “The Creative Curriculum” which focuses on social-emotional, physical, language, cognitive, literacy, and mathematical development.
A spacious and well maintained indoor and outdoor facility.
Free breakfast, lunch, and snacks (food allergies accommodated); all meals meet Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) requirements.
Highly qualified staff: We value education and require our teachers to hold higher education degrees and/or credentials to ensure your children receive the best education possible.
