Who We Are
La Causa Charter School
La Causa Charter School provides education to over 800 students in grades K4 through eighth in a bilingual multicultural environment. We value strong parental and community involvement from the families in our school. Our school team focuses on providing a solid, multi-cultural foundation, one that propels each child on to high school, college, and a lifetime of success in today’s ever-changing global workplace.
At La Causa Charter School, our culturally rich academic programs focus on:
Fine Arts Science and Technology (FAST)
Bilingual Education
English as a Second Language (ESL)
Students have access to a variety of programs, such as, Robotics, Project Lead the Way, Launch Lab, and Video Production where the Eagle News Network is produced. They participate in choir, dance and perform with cuatros, guitars, and percussion instruments in our Eagle Orchestra.
We provide our students with more than just an education – our curriculum encourages problem solving as well as artistic and creative expression.
