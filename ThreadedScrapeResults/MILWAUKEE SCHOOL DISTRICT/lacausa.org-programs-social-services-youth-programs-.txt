Who We Are
La Causa Social Services Youth Programs
La Causa, Inc.’s Social Services Youth Programs focus on providing an array of services that improve a family’s quality of life, such as crisis stabilization, treatment foster care, teen pregnancy prevention, and sexual exploitation prevention. We are proud to be Milwaukee County’s largest provider of Wraparound services. Whether services are court ordered or voluntary, our programs focus on a strength-based approach which encourages stability, empowerment, and family development.
Each child is assigned a Care Coordinator who supports them and their family. The Care Coordinator will work with the family to develop a comprehensive Crisis Plan and assist in preventing and responding to crisis. In addition, Care Coordinators help families obtain the resources they need to maintain stability.
