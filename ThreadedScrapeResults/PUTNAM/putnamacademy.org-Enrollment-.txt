Enrollment
Open enrollment to Putnam Academy is available annually during the month of March. You’ll find the announcement in the Palatka Daily News, and we’ll mail postcards to all rising sixth graders in the school district. We select students for enrollment using a lottery process.
Who is Eligible to Attend?
Putnam Academy is open to any middle school student in Putnam County, regardless of race, creed, color, gender, income, or disability, as long as space is available. The enrollment cap for Putnam Academy is 66 students per grade. Students who are not selected in the initial lottery or those who applied for enrollment after our classes reach capacity are placed on a waiting list. When vacancies occur, we will fill the slots from the waiting list using a lottery process.
Non-Discrimination Statement
Putnam Academy of Arts and Sciences, Inc. does not discriminate based on race, age, gender, color, national origin, disability, religion or otherwise as may be prohibited by state and federal law.
