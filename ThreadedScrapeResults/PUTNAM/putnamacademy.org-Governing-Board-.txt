Our Governing Board
The individuals on our school board are elected community members who volunteer their time for the benefit of our school and the students who attend it. They assist in planning, budgeting, and implementing school programs and help ensure fiscal responsibility.
Please Join Us
We hold our governing board meetings at 4:45 p.m. every third Thursday in the Commons. We’ll be sure to announce any special meetings (with times and locations) in advance.
We value the input of our community and invite you to provide your comments regarding the items open for review. Please provide us with your comments so that we may take all viewpoints into consideration prior to making a decision.
