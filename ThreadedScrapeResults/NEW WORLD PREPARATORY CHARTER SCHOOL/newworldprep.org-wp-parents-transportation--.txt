Transportation
Yellow School Busing begins at the beginning of the school year. All families will receive information regarding busing prior to the end of the school year. Returning scholars will have the same bus stops. New scholars will have their bus stop assigned according to their address.
MetroCards are given to those scholars that live at least half a mile away from the school, do not have a yellow school bus that serves their address, or have requested it.
Scholars who live half a mile to mile away from the campus will receive a Half-Fare MetroCard, and those that live more than a mile away will receive a Full-Fare MetroCard.
All families: please be advised that during arrival and dismissal the area closest to their school building and gym and Sharpe Ave are for the drop-off and pick-up of scholars. Please DO NOT PARK or wait in these areas for your child. These areas are reserved for Yellow School Buses.
If you have any questions regarding scholar transportation, please contact Mr. Brett in the Main Office.
