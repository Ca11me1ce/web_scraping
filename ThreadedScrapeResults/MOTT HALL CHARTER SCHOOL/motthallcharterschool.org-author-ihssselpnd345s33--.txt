About Mott Hall Charter School
The mission of the Mott Hall Charter School is to prepare our scholars in mind, body, and character to succeed in top high schools, colleges, and careers by becoming inquisitive, open-minded, and compassionate citizens of the world. 
A Whole Child
Approach to Learning
At MHCS we believe that in order to be successful we must provide a holistic educational experience, tending to the developing mind, body, and character of our young scholars. Only in this way will we be preparing leaders for the 21st century.
Mind
Body
Character
Social Emotional Health
College Readiness
Mind
Mott Hall Charter School offers a rigorous academic program grounded in the International Baccalaureate Middle Years Programme. This approach provides a student-centered and inquiry-based learning experience that strives to make learning engaging, relevant, and connected to a global context.  Scholars are required to take three years of foreign language, coursework in the arts, and have the opportunity for Regents level classes in mathematics and science in 8th grade. All Mott Hall classes integrate technology and utilize elements of the AVID College and Career Readiness program to provide scholars with the organizational, time management, and study skills they need to succeed.
Body
Middle school students are in a critical time for their physical health and development. They are full of energy, beginning to experience significant changes to their bodies, and are gaining more independence in making choices for themselves.  In our efforts to curb the rate of childhood obesity in our community and to create healthy citizens Mott Hall has a no sugar or high fructose corn syrup policy on our campus. All scholars take physical education and health class each week including instruction in sexual health.
Under the guidance of a skilled coaching staff, Mott Hall offers a wide variety of after school athletic clubs and teams for both boys and girls including soccer, flag football, basketball and more.  These opportunities not only help our scholars stay healthy they also provide college bound skills.
Character
RISE Core Values
Through our core values we teach our scholars the character skills to overcome the obstacles they face to being successful in life.  These core values are Responsibility, Integrity, Scholarship, and Excellence. Scholars are introduced to these attributes from the moment they walk through our door and our values are reinforced throughout their time at Mott Hall through our school culture, our RISE Incentive Program, and our school affirmation.
Teaching Good Choices
Our behavior and discipline approach provides an age-appropriate response to scholar misbehavior. We set firm limits for acceptable behavior and help teach scholars to make the right choices for themselves. When they do not we provide additional opportunities for them to practice the skills they need in small group and one-on-one settings.
School Uniform
To foster a learning community free of distraction Mott Hall upholds a strict uniform policy. The policy is strictly enforced, with scholars expected to be in full uniform whenever they are on school grounds. Amendments to the uniform are only allowed for medical or religious reasons.  Wearing our uniform each day reflects all four of our school’s core values of responsibility, integrity, scholarship, and excellence.

Social Emotional Health
In order to make it to a top performing high school, our scholars will have to work harder than ever before, with greater focus, and more self-discipline. Our social and emotional health program helps scholars manage stressors they face at school and home, learn self-regulation strategies, and develop the emotional intelligence required to successfully navigate this time in their lives. Our supports include:
Social and emotional health assessments
Training for all staff in trauma and attachment theory and strength-based interventions.
Individual and Group Counseling
Body-mind techniques including breathing, guided imagery, visualization, meditation, and yoga.
Parent support groups
College Readiness
College readiness begins in the 6th grade as scholars gain the mindset and skills necessary to succeed in a college preparatory high school and ultimately in college. Mott Hall offers a comprehensive College Readiness Program which includes:
Personalized high school vision plan for every scholar.
High School placement and application assistance
Top performing high school and college visits
Test Preparation
Partnerships with high school placement programs such as Prep for Prep and the Boys Club of New York.
College Bound after school enrichment.
Our after school program allows scholars to pursue an interest and build skills in activities they can pursue in high school and college. These activities include visual art, music, theater, dance, STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics), Basketball, Football, and Soccer.
College and Career Learning Journeys and International Travel
To expose our scholars to the world beyond their immediate neighborhood, MHCS coordinates opportunities for them to learn first hand about various industries and what it takes to be successful in each. Learning Journeys have included exposure to finance at Goldman Sachs, hospitality at Amali Restaurant, fashion design at C Ronson, environmental conservation at Rocking the Boat, and more.
Scholars who have embodied our core values have the opportunity to travel abroad to learn about other cultures and ways of life.
Conversant Mentor Initiative
Part mentorship, part vocabulary and grammar lesson, and part training in the art of conversation, the MHCS Conversant Mentor Initiative pairs Scholars one-to-one with a professional adult.  The adult shares his or her career path, introduces new vocabulary words, corrects common grammatical mistakes, and helps the Scholar hone the important skill of conversation.
Is Mott Hall Charter School a good fit for you?
We are seeking scholars interested in rising to the challenge of gaining entry into a top high school and ultimately going to college. These are young people who are willing to develop the core values of responsibility, integrity, scholarship, and excellence and demonstrate these values by wearing their uniform proudly, completing their homework every night, seeking out help from teachers and other adults when they need it, and developing college bound skills and interests through our enrichment program.
If you are ready to rise to this challenge Mott Hall is for you.
