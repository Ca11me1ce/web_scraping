		City Councilwoman Morgan Visits RCSA Elementary
City Councilwoman Joyce Morgan visited RCSA Elementary Friday.
She toured the school with two Safety Patrol students, visiting Kindergarten, 3rd and 4th grade classrooms.
Morgan helped Kindergarten students making terrariums for Earth Day and learned with 4th grade scientists separating a solution. She visited the media center, garden and 3D printers and enjoyed the students and staff dressed up as historical figures to celebrate History Day.
Morgan also took some time to talk with school leaders. Thank you, Councilwoman Morgan, for taking the time to visit RCSA!
