Dear Parent/Guardian,
Studies show that parental involvement in a student's education is one of the most important factors in raising student self-esteem and academic achievement.  Moreover, most experts agree that parental involvement should go beyond attendance at teacher conferences and open house.  We realize, however, that each of our families is unique – with its own priorities, needs, talents, and time constraints -- and so we try to provide as many different kinds of opportunities for parental involvement as possible.  Please review the volunteer opportunities suggested below, and check any you are interested in -- or tell us what you would like to do.  Then return the form to our School.
