		Homecoming Week at RCSA High
Students and staff celebrated a happy Homecoming week at RCSA High last week.
Dress down tickets allowed creative students to dress in pajamas and as their favorite meme and old person during the week.
Students battled between the grades Friday at a pep rally for the basketball teams. Representatives from each class participated in different fun events, like a wheelbarrow race, free throw shoot and balloon run while their classmates cheered them on.
Students enjoyed performances by two talented dance groups and celebrated the boys’ basketball team before their big game Friday night.
Saturday was the annual Homecoming Dance where students enjoyed dressing up with friends for the night. Thanks to teachers and staff for making this week a memorable one for students.
