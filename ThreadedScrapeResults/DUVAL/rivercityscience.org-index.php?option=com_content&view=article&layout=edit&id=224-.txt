		STEM and Health Expo Draws Record Crowds
The 6th annual STEM and Health Expo was RCSA's biggest and best yet.
More than 5,000 guests gathered in the sunshine Feb. 10 for the Expo. Attendees enjoyed more than 50 student projects and 75 vendors.
Guests of all ages were able to navigate robots, interact with exotic animals, toy with advanced technology, practice yoga and launch robots. They also played in bounce houses, had their faces painted and enjoyed nitrogen ice cream.
Vendors like Microsoft and Medtronic allowed guests to interact with the latest technology, and others like JEA and the St. John’s Riverkeeper shared information on energy and conservation. Guests also accessed important resources for the mind from organizations like Hope Haven and the Youth Crisis Center and for the body from chiropractors, fitness and health experts. 
The main STEM events added excitement to the day. The crowds screamed in delight when the colorful elephant toothpaste erupted into the air and thousands of ping pong balls rained from the sky.
Thank you to our sponsors for making this event possible, as well as the hard working RCSA staff, students and teachers. We are already looking forward to next year's event!
