		  STEM Education
Careers in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) fields are growing, and today’s students must be prepared to enter a world of STEM. However, STEM education is not just about biology, chemistry and algebra. In STEM education, students learn to confront any problem and work creatively to find a solution. Students often work in teams on hands-on projects and experiments, learning important lessons in planning, leadership and confidence along the way.
At RCSA, students are surrounded by opportunities to deepen their critical thinking skills through STEM education. Teachers and students utilize technology daily and offer opportunities in computer science. Guest speakers, community partners and field trips allow students to explore careers in STEM and see how the skills they learn will help them in the future.
STEM education is integrated into the classroom, but students are also successful in STEM after school through clubs and academic teams.
Science Olympiad
RCSA competes in local, regional and national science Olympiad competitions. RCSA is one of the top competitors in the state, having won many regional honors.
Math Olympiad
Students compete in various math competitions at all levels including Math League and Math Counts. Students learn a love for mathematics and problem-solving strategies.
Robotics
In Robotics Club, students design, build and program a robot and learn how robots can solve real world problems. Students battle other schools in various competitions.
Annual STEM and Health Expo
RCSA hosts a widely successful STEM and Health Expo every year for the community. The event features shows, health experts and many hands-on, interactive experiments and experiences for students of all ages and their families to learn.
