		Science and Math Olympiad Teams Win Big
The middle school Science Olympiad team journeyed to Orlando for the Seminole Science Invitational Tournament.
Five students took home first place medals. Seven students came in second place, and five in third place in various events.
The same day, the Math Olympiad team competed at Kernan Middle School. They finished 4th overall out of 15 total teams.
Two students took home first place medals, and one team placed third.
These victories show the hard work of all students and coaches in preparing for competition. We can’t wait to see what they do next!
