		Lt. Governor visit
On Thursday, May 19th, Lieutenant Governor Carlos Lopez Cantera visited RCSA, just before the STEM and Health Expo. Mr. Cantera got a small taste of what the public would experience at this big event a few days before it happened.  He was able to see a number of Science Olympiad experiments, to view some of the robotics projects with the robotics team, and to try his hand at a few experiments in the chemistry lab. A news crew covering the STEM Expo from WJXT Channel 4 Elizabeth Campbell  happened to be here at the same time and even joined in with him for a few of the experiments. Mr. Cantera also visited a number of classrooms in the elementary, middle, and high school, spending time with students and even opening up for students’ questions in a middle school civics class.
