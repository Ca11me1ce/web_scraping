		School Board Member Lori Hershey Visited RCSA Mandarin
School Board Member Lori Hershey wanted to hear what all the talk is about.
She heard families were pulling their children out of other excellent public schools to move them to a new school- RCSA Mandarin. She came to see the school herself and find out why.
Student tour guides showed Hershey around the brand-new building of the campus housing grades 3-7. The school doubled in size since last year and will add 8th grade next year.
Hershey watched science lab demonstrations, visited the newly outfitted media center and spoke to students working on RCSA's unique curriculum. She also stopped to admire cards created by students to send to victims of the Las Vegas shooting.
Students presented Hershey with a custom gift- personalized keychains they 3D printed. Last year, RCSA Mandarin purchased four 3D printers using grant money that allowed the school to purchase the latest classroom technology.
Hershey said she understood why parents were drawn to the warm atmosphere of the school. RCSA is excited to welcome her back for the grand opening celebration October 23.
