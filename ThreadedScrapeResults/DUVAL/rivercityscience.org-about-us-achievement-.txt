		Achievement
When RCSA was founded in 2007, it served two grades, 6th and 7th, at one location. Today, River City Science Academy welcomes more than 2,000 students from K-12 at four campuses across Jacksonville. RCSA quickly became the first A+ Charter School in Jacksonville and is recognized as a High Performing Charter School by the Florida Dept. of Education. RCSA is fully accredited as a quality school by SACS CASI AdvancED Accreditation Commission.
RCSA is renowned across the region for its Science Olympiad program. The Rockets are Regional Science Olympiad Champions and have received all medals across all grade levels. Even the youngest RCSA scientists dominate in competition, placing third overall in regional competition with many students taking home individual medals. RCSA has received honors in Math League, Math Counts and regional and state history fair, showing the dedication and academic skill of its students and staff.
The greatest honors RCSA receives come in the words of our families and the impact on our students. RCSA has worked to be a school that educates the whole child. RCSA has been recognized in service learning and students are actively involved in several national organizations for community work. RCSA is unmatched in cultural diversity, and the wide range of backgrounds, languages and perspectives are celebrated at events like the International Festival and in the classroom every day.
