We are the first and only Montessori public school in New York City and our goal is to bring the best Montessori education to our incredible children in the South Bronx.  Our goals are ambitious as well as expensive compared to the inadequate and inequitable funding for public Charter schools. To give the individual attention and support our children need we rely on and encourage believers to donate to help pave the way for our student’s success by making a generous gift today. We welcome any size donation.
Your gift will support every aspect of our school community including the following:
 A set of classroom library books
 Take-home books for every child
 Field trips outside of the South Bronx
 Music and art materials for our integrated curriculum
 Technology in the classroom
 Outside support to help struggling students to bridge learning gaps
Thank you for your support!
