 School Network. Frequent testing is conducted in order to evaluate student learning and permit timely, positive intervention. Testing students in this way has a number of very important advantages:

Students develop the ability to focus and to sustain concentration for increasingly long periods
Feedback from testing allows close monitoring and follow-up
Diagnostic Tests are
