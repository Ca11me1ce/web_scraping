School History
The Mid-Michigan Leadership Academy (MMLA) is a tuition-free, K-8 Charter School in Lansing, Michigan. We are located near Old Town on the campus that was once home to the Michigan School for the Blind. MMLA opened in 1996 and is authorized by Central Michigan University. The school is presently serving 285 students in grades K-8 and also offers a Great Start Readiness Program designed to prepare students for Kindergarten.
In the fall of 2013, MMLA became a member of the 
SABIS®
 Network, a global network of schools which currently educates over 70,000 students and has an active presence in 20 countries on five continents.
School Mission
The mission of the Mid-Michigan Leadership Academy (MMLA) is to be a provider of top-quality education to a highly diverse student body. MMLA will prepare all students for success in college, equip them with the ability and desire for lifelong learning, and strengthen their civic, ethical, and moral values. MMLA will maintain high standards of efficiency and accountability throughout its operation.
