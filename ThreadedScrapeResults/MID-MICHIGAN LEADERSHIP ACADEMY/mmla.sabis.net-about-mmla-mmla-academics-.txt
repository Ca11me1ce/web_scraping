Approach to Education
All students should be prepared for university and a life of continuous learning
All students should be helped to realize their full potential, empowering them to make informed decisions in life
All students should grow in confidence and self-esteem
The maximum possible "value" should be added to all aspects of each student's education
All students should be encouraged to become well-rounded citizens who contribute positively to their communities
Class Teaching
The whole class is taught together, using the unique 
SABIS
 Point System®. The key concepts of a lesson are listed. Each of these is taught interactively, alternating oral work, individual written work, and group checking. Class time is utilized to build a solid foundation of knowledge through interacting, analyzing, forming and expressing opinions, and effective discussion. Discussions are based on critical thinking and logical reasoning.
Student Follow-up
Students who fall behind in their work are advised, motivated, helped and coached until they catch up. As long as students manage their own time successfully their time is theirs, otherwise we take over to support and guide their efforts.
The Learning Process
All courses are structured. A unique system of academic tracking (the 
SABIS
 Academic Monitoring System®, which is a computerized method of detecting gaps in knowledge) allows the administration to closely follow the progress of each individual. Gaps are pinpointed as soon as they form, and the students' efforts are focused on eliminating them. Valuable time is saved, and a gap-free, cohesive foundation of knowledge is built in students' minds.
Curriculum Overview
The backbone of the 
SABIS®
 Educational System is a rigorous and sequential curriculum that meets world-class standards. Supported by time-tested methods, this curriculum emphasizes a well-balanced body of knowledge, skills, and experiences. A critical review of the curriculum by 
SABIS®
 Academic Development Department is ongoing to ensure that it remains dynamic, comprehensive, and suited to the needs of a rapidly changing, global society.
In addition to the core subjects of English, mathematics, and world languages, the 
SABIS®
 curriculum is designed to provide knowledge of a broad range of subjects including science, social studies, art, music, health, physical education, and computers. It is designed to develop a balanced, well-rounded, college-preparatory experience.
The first step in the 
SABIS®
 curriculum development process is the identification of all concepts and skills for a given class, followed by their classification as essential and non-essential.
Essential concepts are those needed for future learning and not formally taught after initial mastery. For example, the concept of converting from decimal to percent is not an essential concept for fifth grade. It becomes essential in sixth grade because it is needed for future grades and is not taught in later mathematics classes. Expectations in terms of mastery allow for differences in student abilities and efforts. All students must master essential concepts at 100% accuracy to advance to a higher grade level.
Non-essential concepts are those that do not interfere with future learning but are part of the curriculum. All students must master a set amount over and above the minimum requirement and will tackle some areas more extensively. It is within this body, over and above the essential, that the amount and depth of knowledge that students achieve varies.
The body of knowledge-the facts and skills-that makes up the content of a course will not be learned in its entirety by all students. Even the most structured learning, such as mathematics, is not strictly linear. One of the strengths of the 
SABIS®
 curriculum is its identification of essential and non-essential knowledge.
Academic Goals
