Enrollment Information
We are happy to welcome you and your family to Chandler Park Academy.
Methods of Applying
Applications for enrollment can be placed in one the following ways:
1.  Stop in:  Come and see us and we will give you an application.
2.  Phone:  Please call the school office, and we can either fax you an application or send one to your home.
In order to apply to our school, you must be a resident of the State of Michigan.
Open Enrollment
Open enrollment is designed to give all interested parents/guardians equal opportunity for their child to attend Chandler Park Academy. During open enrollment, all applications get equal consideration regardless of date submitted. An application received at the end of open enrollment receives equal treatment to one received on the first day of open enrollment.
Following the close of open enrollment, if the number of applications exceeds the number of open seats, a random selection lottery determines acceptance. If the number of applications does not exceed the number of open seats, all applicants are accepted for their respective grade.
Lottery
Lotteries are open to the public and parents are encouraged to attend. The date, time and place of the lottery is communicated in writing to all applicants. Lotteries will be held for any grade in which the number of applications exceeds the number of openings. Names are randomly selected and applicants are accepted based on the order in which they are selected. The lottery continues until all names are drawn. Applicants who are not accepted will be placed on a waiting list in the order their names were selected.
Sibling Preference
In order to accommodate parents who have more than one child eligible for enrollment; siblings of students accepted during the lottery or currently enrolled students are given preference over students who don’t have accepted or enrolled siblings. Siblings will be offered the first available seat in their respective grade or placed on a waiting list with sibling preference.  Sibling preference is defined as children who have at least one common parent/legal guardian AND are living in the same household at least 50% of the time.
Waiting Lists
It is not unusual for a small percentage of accepted students to select other options prior to the start of school. Openings created by opt-outs are filled by those on waiting lists.  Do not become discouraged if your child is put on a waiting list. Openings can and do become available. In the event space becomes available, you will be contacted by our office.
Our student application process is designed to provide equal opportunity for your child to attend our school.
