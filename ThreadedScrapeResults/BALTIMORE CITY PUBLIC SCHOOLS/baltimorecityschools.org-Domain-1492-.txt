Welcome
Dear Students, Parents and Community:
Welcome to Thomas Johnson Elementary Middle School (TJEMS). TJEMS is located in the historic Federal Hill/South Baltimore neighborhood, and we serve students in pre-kindergarten through eighth grade with an early learning program for three year olds. TJEMS is one of the top performing schools in the district and state, as demonstrated by state assessment scores. Recent renovations to the school building include the addition of a $1 million library and media center, a science lab, two computer labs, and a new playground. Highly effective teachers, a rigorous curriculum, and low class size help promote learning. 
This school website is designed to provide you with important information about our school including, school events, academic performance, TJEMS news, school policy, and PTO and School Family Council meeting dates. I hope that this website will be a useful resource to current TJ families and that it will provide necessary information to prospective students and parents. Please visit our website regularly to stay informed about current events. 
Sincerely,
James A. Dendinger
