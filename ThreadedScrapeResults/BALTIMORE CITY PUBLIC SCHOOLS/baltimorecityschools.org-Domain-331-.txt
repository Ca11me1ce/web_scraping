Welcome
Welcome to City Springs School!
Where children feel the joy of learning!
City Springs is a well-loved, highly regarded neighborhood school which continues to grow and improve. In 2005, City Springs enrollment was 398. It is currently 763. This increase in enrollment is due to the fact that more and more people in the neighborhood chose to send their students to their neighborhood school. In fact, the demand for seats at City Springs has exceeded capacity, necessitating the improvement of a portion of an adjacent school to house its pre-k-2nd grades. Parents know that their students will receive excellent instruction; a full complement of arts, sports, and clubs; access to health care at the school’s clinic; a positive environment dedicated to the daily use of Restorative Practices; recognition for accomplishments; and above all, success.
City Springs follows an intersession calendar, which is different from Baltimore City’s school calendar.  To view our 2017-18 school year calendar,
