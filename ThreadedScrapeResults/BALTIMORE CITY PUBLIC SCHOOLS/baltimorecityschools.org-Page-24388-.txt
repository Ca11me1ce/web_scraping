School Performance Plans
The School Performance Plan is a blueprint designed to support principals and school leadership teams in improving overall school performance, with an emphasis on instruction and student achievement. The tool is an anchor for year-round reflective evaluation and strategic planning. Because the plans are referred to and used year round, they are "living documents" that may be updated based on ongoing reflection and discussion. The plans linked below were current as of February 3, 2017. Upon review of a school's SPP, the public is offered the opportunity to provide 
comment on the specifics of the SPP through the following form
. The form will be collected then shared with the school principal for review and consideration in the school's continued efforts to provide high quality academics and a safe and supportive learning environment for students. 
Click on a school name to download that school's plan in PDF format. 
 Please note that charter schools that do not have Title I programs are not required to prepare School Performance Plans — and so may not appear on the list below.
