Welcome
Dear Parent(s):
Baltimore City Public Schools has fully implemented the Maryland Common Core Curriculum with fidelity that will help our students’ prepare for the PARCC (Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers) assessment. Our students will continue to take the MSA in science next year in grade 5. As a school, we will provide our students with additional supports such as interventions provided by the classroom teacher that are embedded in the instructional day. We will utilize a program entitled SPIRE for reading, Literacy Modules and Do the Math for mathematics. We will be implementing PBIS (Positive Behavior Intervention and Supports) program with our students to create a safe learning environment that is conducive to learning and that focus on and rewards positive behaviors. We will still have Villa Marie Counseling services for students who need additional supports as well as a school social worker and school psychologist. In addition, we have been awarded another grant this year to continue our Fresh Fruits and Vegetables program for the students. Isn’t this GREAT NEWS. In addition, we will also continue our school’s Food Pantry led by our community partners Mr. George Mitchell President of Neighborhoods United and Ms. Cherring Spence President of Parklane Community Association. Mr. Mitchell and Ms. Spence are actively involved in supporting our school.
We are a SABES (STEM Achievement in Baltimore Elementary Schools) school. We look forward to engaging out students in science, technology, engineering and math. Our students in grades one through five are departmentalized which means that they work with at least two teachers who focus on literacy and social studies and the other teacher focus on math and science.
At Edgecombe Circle Elementary, we promote a healthy lifestyle. Our school has a school garden in which students have planted fresh vegetables. Students share daily healthy nutritional facts each morning to the entire student body along with a staff led warm-up exercise.
Educationally Yours,
Gloria E. Pulley, Principal
