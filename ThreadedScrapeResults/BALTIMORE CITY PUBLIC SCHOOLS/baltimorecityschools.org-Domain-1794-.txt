ANNOUNCEMENTS
Supply List 2017-2018
WELCOME!
Welcome to Walter P. Carter Elementary Middle School. WPC is a community based school with a strong focus on scholar's academic and personal acheivements. No two WPC scholars are the same! We foster excellence and individuality in all of our scholars.
WPC Core Values
I will energize my community.
It is not enough to simply be a great student or teacher. We expect all members of our community to take what is learned at WPC and use that knowledge to make a difference in the larger community. This means both serving others and inspiring peers to do the same.
I will achieve greatness.
We have exceptionally high expectations for everyone at WPC. All members of the WPC community will strive to be excellent in all areas of life. Success can be defined differently for each individual. As long as progress is always being made towards clear, challenging goals, individuals are achieving greatness.
I will respect myself and others.
The WPC community is comprised of unique individuals who come together to achieve a common goal. We value the background, skill set and characteristics of each person. We understand that no person has reached his or her full potential. In order to respect all individuals, we must first respect ourselves by treating ourselves with love and kindness.
I will discover my best self.
We will constantly work to enhance our skills and discover our passions and strengths. We will take risks, challenge ourselves, and work to love ourselves for both who we are and for whom we can become.
I will dream fearlessly.
As a member of the WPC community, we recognize the importance of having “I dreams” and “we dreams.” No societal boundaries will limit our personal goals and aspirations. No challenges will prevent us from envisioning a world more just than the present and from taking steps to make that world a reality.
I will share my brilliance.
All individuals have skills to share with the community. It is our responsibility to fully spread our talents and gifts to those around us. Only when all individuals do so, can we solve the world’s most difficult challenges.
WPC Elementary- Creed Myself
I must learn to respect myself
When I do, I will be able to respect others.
When I respect others, my family, friends, neighbors, and teachers
will be proud of me.
I must remember, I am somebody!
When I learn to listen, I will be able to learn.
Good manners make me a beautiful person.
WPC Middle School -The Scholar Creed
The community of scholars on the Walter P. Carter Elementary/Middle School Campus is dedicated to personal and academic excellence.
Choosing to live in the community obligates each member to a code of civilized behavior.
Allegiance to these ideals requires each Walter P. Carter Elementary/Middle School Campus scholar to refrain from and discourage behaviors which threaten the freedom and respect every individual deserves.
As a Walter P. Carter Campus scholar,
I will practice personal and academic integrity;
I will respect the right and property of others;
I will discourage bigotry, while striving to learn from differences in people, ideas and opinions;
I will demonstrate concern for others, their feelings, and their needs for conditions that support their work and development.
- based on Morehouse College’s Student Creed
