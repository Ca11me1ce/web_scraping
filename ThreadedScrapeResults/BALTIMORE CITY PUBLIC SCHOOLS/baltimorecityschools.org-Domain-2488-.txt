Welcome
 Dear Pimlico Parents/Guardians,  
   Welcome to the 2017-2018 school year. On behalf of the faculty and staff, we would like to extend a warm welcome to all students and their families. I am honored to serve as your principal. This school year, while focusing on encompassing the true meaning of being a community school, we will also focus on continuing our goal of meeting academic success. We share a partnership in the educational journey of our children and are looking forward to collaborating with you to ensure that our students are meeting success in all social and academic areas.
   The efforts of the staff to create a climate for learning at Pimlico are reflected in the accomplishments and achievements of our students. Our school will continue to implement the Common Core Standards with fidelity and provide our scholars with enriching opportunities throughout the school year to prepare them for the task of becoming college and career ready.
Thank you for entrusting us to prepare your child for the 21
st
 century workforce. 
Pimlico has an open door policy and we encourage you to become a volunteer. 
Best,
Principal Alston
