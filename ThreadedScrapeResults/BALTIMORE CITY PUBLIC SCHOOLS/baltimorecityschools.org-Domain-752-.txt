Welcome
Our Mission...
To provide a differentiated instructional program to meet the needs of all students
Our Vision...
To create lifelong learners who will become responsible citizens
Welcome to the Dynamic Dallas F. Nicholas, Sr. Elementary School, where all staff members are “Committed to Academic Excellence for All Students”.   
Our school day begins at 7:55 a.m. and ends at 2:40 p.m. Breakfast is served from 7:30-8:00 a.m. 
We are a uniform school. Students wear white tops and navy blue bottoms. Attendance and punctuality are crucial to student achievement, therefore, we expect to see all students every day, on time, and prepared to engage in the learning experience.  We expect all students to: Be Prepared, Be Respectful, Be Responsible, Be Cooperative, and Be Safe.
Our theme this year is "Dallas Pride...Take pride in our work.  Take pride in our self.  Take pride in our school."  We take pride in our work by doing our best every day.  We take pride in our self by wearing our uniforms daily.  We take pride in our school by keeping our building beautiful and clean.  Remember, Dallas Pride!!
Join the staff, parents, and community/business partners as we work together to make achievement a reality for all students.
