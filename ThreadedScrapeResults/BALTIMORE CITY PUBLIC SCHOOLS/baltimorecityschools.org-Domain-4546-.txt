Welcome
From the Principal’s Desk
Parents of The Vivien T. Thomas Medical Arts Academy, welcome to the 2017-2018 school year!  We are prepared and ready to equip your child with all the necessary tools for academic success this school year. 
Our school is a community of students and staff who share a passion for building a strong academic foundation for today's youth. What makes VTTMAA unique is its focus on health professions, mathematics, and sciences. It is an academic program that encourages students to enter careers in health.
In addition, VTTMAA provides an academically rigorous curriculum that prepares students to enter the nation's best colleges and universities.  We are guided by the principle of “Above the Line” thinking.  We believe by modeling an “I can do this” philosophy, our students master success in all area of their lives.
Please be reminded that we have in-house resources to assist your child academically if the need should arise.  Advance Recovery Program, Not-Yet-Graded Policy, and Coach Class are available for student support and enrichment.  As well, know that you are welcome as family in our school building.
Stephanie Farmer
Principal
