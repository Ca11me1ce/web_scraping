Dear Parents/Guardians:
On behalf of the entire North Bend Elementary Middle School faculty and staff, I extend a warm welcome to all our students and their families. I am excited about this school year and look forward to working with you. It is our commitment to provide all students with an enriched educational program, encouraging all students to reach their fullest potential and be college and career ready. In order to fully prepare our students, we will continue with full implementation of the Common Core State Standards.
It is our goal to build stronger partnerships with our parents and community members. Community involvement and parent participation are key elements to the success of our students. It is a parent’s enthusiasm that inspires children to do their best. It is a parent’s involvement that is one of the biggest indicators of a child’s success. And it is a parent’s nurturing and guidance that allow children to develop a true love of learning. It is our hope that you will continue to work with teachers to ensure your child has all the necessary tools to make this school year fun and successful.
Please know you are always welcome to discuss any problem, concern or idea with both me and the entire staff. Working together, in partnership, we will make 2017-2018 an amazing year full of pride and accomplishments!
Patricia Burrell
Principal
