Welcome
Welcome to Hazelwood Elementary/Middle School #210
Exposure....Experiences....Access! We believe that every child can demonstrate his or her best through providing exposure to new things daily, great experiences outside of the classroom and school, and access to the best of everything. Our teachers are some of the BRIGHTEST in BALTIMORE and beyond. They are ready and prepared to challenge every student and help them explore the world as they learn beyond their wildest dreams.
We expect every student to strive for excellence by attending school every day on time and prepared. We expect our parents to work with us as partners to ensure every child finds success and reach their academic goals. We expect every student to be engaged and to take ownership of their learning by being cooperative in class, diligent in completing assignments, and excited about their growth.
This school year will be one of many new and exciting changes for Hazelwood. We're thrilled that you're going to be a part of this magnificent journey. It's always a great day for learning and exploration.

Read, Read, Read
Every child grows by reading at home. Encourage your child to read books, magazines, and newspapers everyday. Our goal is for each student to grow at least ONE full year in their reading level. You can help by encouraging your child to read at least 15 minutes every day, talking with your child about what they read and ask questions to help them organize their thoughts; and last by visiting the neighborhood library at least twice per month. Allow your child to check out books, participate in story hour, and join book clubs. 
Here at Hazelwood, we expect every student to become a reading scholar and perform at grade level in reading.
