WELCOME 
September 8th, 2016
Greetings Great GeorgeWashington Elementary School Families!!
Wow! What a great start to the 2016-2017 school year! So much excitement from students, staff, and families has been flowing through our hallways. We take the work of developing, nurturing, supporting, and uplifting our students extremely serious - and we would not be able to do so without the overwhelming support from our great families! Please continue to accept mydeepest gratitude for your amazing support, volunteerism, assistance andpresence.
Please join us for our Back to School Night on Thursday, September 15th from 5:00 pm to 7:00 pm. Light dinner will be served and information from GWES partners will be available. PTA elections for Vice President and Secretary will be taking place as well. If you are interested in running for either of those positions, please stop by the office or call 410-396-1445 to ensure your name will be on the ballot. We can't wait to see you!
Best Regards,
Christophe Turk, Principal
