Welcome
Welcome to the 2017 – 2018 school year at Morrell Park Elementary School, where we S.O.A.R. to exceptional heights!
Morrell Park Elementary Middle School utilizes the Common Core State Standards as the curricular foundation that will place students on the pathway to becoming college and career ready.  We offer a variety of academic programs to assist students as they obtain college, career and civic awareness. Programs offered include: Special Education Program that features inclusion, self-contained classes, and pull-out small groups, intervention groups and after-school tutoring programs that are all designed to meet the needs of all learners.
In order to support the various academic programs, we have a wealth of human resources to assist staff, students, and parents in making sure students’ needs are met.  The administrators, community outreach coordinator, counseling, wellness staff, IEP team, and Student Support Team are here to assist everyone in their efforts.
Morrell Park Elementary Middle School’s mission is to develop the whole child therefore we offer extracurricular programs, including music, athletics, art, and other clubs in order to accomplish our mission. Morrell Park EMS is a community school that partners with Access Art on Washington Boulevard and the Family League to foster positive partnerships within the community.
To provide a safe learning environment, we will continue wearing our school uniforms and expand our P.B.I.S. program where students practice S.O.A.R. (being safe, organized, attentive, and respectful) and learn monthly character traits. We will also follow Baltimore City School District’s Code of Conduct.
Let’s SOAR to the top this school year with Behavior, Academics, and Attendance.  It takes a community to develop a whole child and I welcome you to be a part of the 2017 -2018 MPEMS community.
Sincerely,
Nichelle Johnson,
