Greetings Mighty Duck Family , 
Welcome to the 2016-17 School Year at the Historic Frederick Douglass High School. We hope that you are as excited as we are about the opportunities and challenges facing us this school year. Our vision is to provide a high quality education that prepare our students to be post-secondary education ready, whether they decide to go to college or choose a career after graduation. We are committed to empowering our students by inspiring them to think critically, collaborate and communicate effectively with others, solve problems efficiently, and incorporate their creativity and useful technology to enrich their lives. 
 Frederick Douglass High School has an exciting year of learning planned for our students and we have worked diligently to ensure that we have highly qualified teachers in order to become an institution of learning that meets your high expectations. Our mission is to provide a safe, orderly, supportive, and engaging environment where strong relationships enable all of our stakeholders to set high expectations by nurturing our students' social, moral, intellectual, and physical growth. 
 Frederick Douglass High School offers our students the opportunity to explore and develop interest in several enrichment programs. However, while raising the bar of awareness, academic success, and exploration, we are better preparing our students for the challenges of the 21st Century and the expectations that lie ahead of them. In addition to innovative coursework, Frederick Douglass High School offers student participation in extra-curricular activities and out of the classroom experiences that provides college and career exposure. 
To the families that are just joining us, we welcome you! To those families continuing the journey, you can expect some wonderful, rigorous, and adventurous changes and updates as we embark on our journey. We are extremely pleased that you have chosen the Historic Frederick Douglass High School to groom your son or daughter. Once again, welcome! 
I will also like to use this opportunity to invite you to our Back to School Night on Wednesday, September 14, 2016 at 4:00 pm in the school auditorium. 
We look forward to forging a partnership as we all work as a team to build excellence in our young Scholars. 
Sincerely, 
Kelvin Bridgers 
Principal
