Addressing Bullying and Harassment
Students talk about the importance of preventing bullying. Watch more stories on 
Vimeo
All students have the right to a safe, supportive school environment, free from bullying and harassment. 
Maryland law
 and 
Board of School Commissioners policy
 require it, and City Schools is committed to it. The district takes all incidents of bullying and harassment seriously. 
Reporting incidents of bullying or harassment
Option 1. Contact your child’s school to report the incident(s). The school principal (or designee) must investigate within two school days of receiving a report, and parents should expect to hear about resolution within two further school days. The principal also reports the investigation and action taken to the district office in this time frame, using this 
investigation form
.
Option 2. Complete a "Bullying, Harassment or Intimidation Reporting Form." 
Reports can be completed and submitted online
 or by printing out a 
hard copy
 (
español
) and submitting the completed form to the school. If you don't have access to a printer, copies can be obtained at your child’s school.
Appropriate disciplinary action is taken, as outlined in the 
Code of Conduct
. 
If you are not satisfied with the investigation, please contact the CEO Ombudsman at 443-984-2020.
