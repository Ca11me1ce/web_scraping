If you don’t complete these two items by May 1st, 2018, you will forfeit your space for the 2018-19 school year, will need to re-apply via My School DC, and will be added to the bottom of the waitlist for that specific grade and campus.

What our Students are Saying
“What I like about DC Prep is that they push me to achieve high, not just ‘reachable’, goals. DC Prep is strict, but I am grateful because the teachers want better things for me. In other words, I like my school because they make me work hard for what I want in life.”
Alexis, DC Prep Class of 2016
