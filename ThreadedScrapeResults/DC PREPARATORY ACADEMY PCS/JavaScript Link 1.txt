What our Teachers are Saying
“DC Prep helps adults just as much as it helps children to reach their highest potential. The dedication to excellence and to constant learning is something I have never seen before. It is the reason I wake up smiling every morning because I know that all of us are at DC Prep for the same purpose.”
Angel Hendricks, Dean of Student Support (EEC)
