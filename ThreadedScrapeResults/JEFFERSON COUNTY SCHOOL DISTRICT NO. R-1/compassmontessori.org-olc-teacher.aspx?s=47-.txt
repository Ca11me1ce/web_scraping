Anne Prosser and Tara Ferrin
(303) 420-8288 ext. 228

Anne and Tara have been teaching partners and close friends for over a decade. They began their careers together in lower elementary 14 years ago, this being their 9th year at Compass Montessori. Both come from backgrounds that include experience in Children's House as well as traditional education. Tara is a health enthusiast and expert on gluten free cooking, and additionally is a strong athlete. Anne is an enthusiastic hiker, historian and artist and brings these loves into the classroom. Reading is a passion for both Tara and Anne and establishing a strong reading and math foundation for their students is a high priority. Their love of learning encourages students to follow their own interests, build on their strengths and challenge themselves in areas of weakness. Anne and Tara love the Compass Montessori community and mission and look forward to many more years together in the Acacia Room!
