Hello, my name is 
Kymm
 Garcia, I am a mother of 3 amazing Compass kids. I have been working at Compass for 12 years going on 13.  
I began my Montessori journey over 20 years ago in an infant/toddler class in Denver taking my AMI infant/toddler training in Denver.  Some years later after having my first child I took AMI primary training in Denver.  I came to Compass in 2004 and help to start the primary classrooms at the Golden Campus.  Then in 2013, I began my journey of Elementary training, where I spent 3 glorious summers in training at the Montessori Training Center of Minnesota and teaching in the Garnet classroom.  I have worked with primary children, lower elementary and now upper elementary.
I hold my Colorado State teacher Licensure in ECE with an elementary endorsement.
I hold a BA in family studies and developmental psychology from Metropolitan State College of Denver and a Masters in Education from St Catherine University.  I hold AMI diplomas in Assitant's to Infancy, Primary, and Elementary. 
In my free time, I love hiking, camping and outdoor adventures with my family, as well as running, paddle boarding and biking. Accompanying me each day to school is our trusty classroom dog, Sampson.
Jennifer Mathewson
Jennifer is a certified elementary and special education teacher and has a bachelor’s and master’s degree in Elementary Education. She taught 1st and 2nd grade as well as working as a reading specialist in DPS prior to taking time to raise her 3 children, now ages 11, 13 and 15 - all of whom attended Compass beginning in Children’s House. Jennifer is thankful to be raising her family in the beautiful state of Colorado where she enjoys backpacking, hiking, snowboarding, and gardening. She is also a Jazzercise instructor of 8 years. She worked as a 2nd grade assistant at Mountain Phoenix last year, but is excited to join Compass this year as an employee as well as a parent - a goal she has had since her children started at the Wheat Ridge campus 10 years ago!
