Welcome to the Water Room!  It is so nice to have you join our community.  We have worked together in the Water Room since the 2014/2015 school year and are looking forward to many more years together. 
In our classroom, we embrace a strong culture of independence and proactivity in learning, so come ready!
Communication
The best way to communicate with us is in person before or after school or through either of our Compass emails.
Any “Friday Folder” documents will be included in the “Friday Folder” page on our classroom site. Please check this frequently, as we will be going digital with our handouts.

Reminder: Our Spring Open House Conferences are this Thursday, March 23, 2017, from 3:00-5:00 PM. This is a student led conference where you can expect to receive a lesson from your child, perhaps receive a tour of the materials/shelves in our environment, as well as review their works compiled in their cubbies and/or portfolio. See you there!

B-I-N-G-O! We are in dire need of volunteers for our classroom's bingo session at Slammer's on Sunday, March 26th. These sessions are so crucial to our classrooms and we really need your help in filling the spots! If you are available on this day, please follow the link below to sign-up!

Today was Pi Day! We want to celebrate the pies that were cooked! We also want to extend a huge thank you to the chaperones that volunteered their time and homes for the children; today would not have been successful without out!
