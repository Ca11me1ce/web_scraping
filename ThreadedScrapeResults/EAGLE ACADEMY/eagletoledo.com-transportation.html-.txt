Transportation
Dismissal
Students with signed parental authorization on file at school are permitted to walk home from school.  Students may also be picked up by parents or other authorized persons designated by the parents.  Please notify the office of any changes or special circumstances as soon as possible.  Eagle Academy staff will make every effort to ensure your child's safety.
Bus Service
Eagle Academy offers free school bus service for students in the Toledo area who live more than one mile from the school.  Please contact the school office for the required forms.  If your family moves or changes emergency contact information during the school year, please contact the school with your new information so that our records can be updated and new bus arrangements can be made if needed. 
Students who have the opportunity to ride the school buses may do so as long as they display behavior that is safe, respectful, and responsible.  Choosing to engage in unacceptable behavior will result in the loss of bus service.
