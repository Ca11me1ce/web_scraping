Quality Education
The Eagle Academy curriculum comes to life as it brings real-world applications into the classroom. By making learning relevant, students become more interested and involved in the learning experience. Our knowledgeable and professional teaching staff has an active role in updating and implementing curriculum as needed. Our small class sizes and commitment to monitoring student progress through periodic assessments allow us to move quickly, tailoring the daily learning experience to address areas of greatest academic need. 
All of our teachers and classroom assistants are certified and highly qualified, teaching in their respective areas of expertise. The curriculum is fully aligned with the Ohio Academic Content Standards.
