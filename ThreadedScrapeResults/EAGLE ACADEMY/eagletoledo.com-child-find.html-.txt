Child Find Policy
 Eagle Academy is participating in effort to assist the State of Ohio in identifying, locating and  evaluating all children who may have disabilities which may hinder their ability to receive free and appropriate public education.
School districts across the state of Ohio are also participating in this effort to identify disabilities such as hearing impairments, visual impairments, speech or language impairments, specific learning disabilities, emotional disturbances, multiple disabilities, mental retardation, or other health impairments, physical impairments, autism and traumatic brain injuries.
We are committed to affording all children their right to a free and  appropriate education, regardless of any disability a child may have.  However, in order to accomplish this, we must know that a need is present.
Many children with disabilities are not visible because they do not function in the mainstream of the community.  Examples of this may be children of homeless individuals or children of migrant families.  In some cases, parents are not even aware of the fact that their child has a disability and are also unaware of services which are available.
Eagle Academy is interested in meeting the needs of children with disabilities.  If you know of a child who may have disabilities, contact the school leader for more information at (419) 697-2760.
