Tutoring
Free tutoring is available after school for all students.  A flyer is  sent home each quarter listing after school activities that are  available, including tutoring.  To enroll your student in tutoring,  select the grade-level appropriate sessions on the flyer and return it  to the school office.  Tutoring sessions tend to take place two or three  days per week, and usually in a small group setting.  Please contact  your child's teacher for more information.
