Enrollment Information 
We are happy to welcome your family to Eagle Academy. To begin the enrollment process, please fill out the "Enroll Now" form to submit an online enrollment application. You can also enroll by visiting or calling the school.
We are currently enrolling for the 2016-2017 school year for grades 6-9.  Please fill out the "Apply Now" form and we will contact you about availability.  If classes are full, your child will be placed on our waiting list.
Eagle Academy is a tuition-free, public community school.  Current students are given the opportunity to re-enroll in February/March, with preference given to them and their siblings.  The school holds an advertised open enrollment period in the spring, and also accepts applications for enrollment throughout the school year.  Enrollment is open to any resident in the greater Toledo area, and transportation is available in most cases.  Students are enrolled on a first-come, first-served basis.  The academy does not charge tuition nor discriminates in admissions policies or practices on the basis of intellectual or athletic ability, measures of achievement or aptitude, or status.
Please call us for more information.  We look forward to meeting you and working together to help your child succeed!
