Prevention of Opioid Use
The 2016 legislation in Massachusetts requires that parents, guardians, and other adults in a middle and high school extracurricular athlete’s life such as School Nurses, Athletic Directors, Coaches and Athletic Trainers, receive educational materials 
on the dangers of opioid use and misuse
.  Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH) has developed educational materials on opioid misuse prevention and is partnering with schools across the state to share this  information with students, parents and school personnel. Because of the risk of injury and the subsequent need for pain management, student athletes may be at risk for opioid misuse.
If you have any concerns regarding this matter, please contact the school.
