The GLCPS Parent Teacher Organization plans, organizes, and runs many social events such as dances, movie nights, and Family Fun Nights. Fundraisers and volunteers make this happen; without both, we would never be able to hold the many events we have planned for this coming year.
We offer all parents, grandparents and guardians the opportunity to be more involved in the life of the school. We hope to hear from you soon.
Check the calendar for our plans!
