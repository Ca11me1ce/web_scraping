Baked Goods Guideline
The Global Learning Charter Public School staff appreciates our families and their willingness to contribute to the classroom setting by contributing food and other supplies.
Due to the increase in food allergies, diabetes, and other health conditions present in our school population, we have guidelines to ensure the studentsâ€™ health and safety.
Families are asked for their cooperation and NOT bring in baked goods prepared in the home. Food brought to school for special occasions must be in the original packaging, containing the ingredient and nutritional labels. This list of ingredients will be reviewed by appropriate school staff and will be on display during classroom activities to ensure safe consumption of food.
NO TREE NUTS OR PEANUT BUTTER PLEASE !!!!! 
Please be aware that home baked goods will NOT be allowed at school events and will be returned to the student to take home.
We thank you in advance for your support; please feel free to contact the School Nurse with any specific questions, 508-991-4105 ext 515.
