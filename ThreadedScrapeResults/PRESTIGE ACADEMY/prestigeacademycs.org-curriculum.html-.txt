Curriculum
To achieve our school's mission to prepare our students for demanding college preparatory high schools, we adopt the 
Delaware State Content Standards
 and Common Core Standards as required. We also review national and other state standards to ensure rigorous academic preparation for our students and incorporate those standards with the Delaware standards.
The national standards we review include the Common Core, 
National Council of Teachers of Mathematics
, 
National Council of Teachers of English
, 
National Council of Social Studies
, and 
National Science Education Standards
. 
 Like many of the high performing urban charter schools we have studied and upon which much of Prestige Academy's model is built, we believe that with appropriate foundational academic skill mastery, a rigorous and highly disciplined school culture, and extraordinary expectations for academic success, our students will achieve this high bar.
