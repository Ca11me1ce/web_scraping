Family Accountability
The greatest decline in academic performance occurs for boys during the middle school years. Often they enter high school unprepared, many do not graduate, and even fewer go on to college. Sadly, many of our boys are dying. Prestige Academy will prepare our young men for the high schools of their choice, on their way to the colleges of their choice and the opportunity for a real future.
Parents are encouraged and expected to take an active role in their child's education. Our students' success will be a direct result of the collaboration of students, families and staff members.
All families choosing to enroll their children in Prestige Academy must sign a 
Family Covenant
. The covenant describes important responsibilities and school expectations that families accept once they choose to enroll at Prestige Academy.
