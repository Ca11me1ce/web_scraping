Employment
We are looking for candidates passionate about improving children's lives through the promise of a quality education.
Prestige Academy was created to offer a tuition-free, public middle school opportunity to an all male student population in Wilmington and surrounding Delaware communities. In order to address the severe academic under performance and low college matriculation rates of boys from these communities, the school offers a highly rigorous, college-preparatory curriculum supported by a structured school culture. We opened our doors to 103 fifth graders in 2008. We expanded one grade per year and currently serve approximately 300 boys in grades six through eight.
We are looking for talented and dedicated individuals to join our team.  Please see below for current job openings at Prestige.
