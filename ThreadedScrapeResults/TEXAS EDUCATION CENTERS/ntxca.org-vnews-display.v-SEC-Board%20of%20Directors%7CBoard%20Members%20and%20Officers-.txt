North Texas Collegiate Academy School Board
School board members donate countless hours of their time annually to prepare for meetings, attend meetings, fulfill training requirements, and support school-related functions.  The word "donate" is an important one because school board members are volunteers who receive no pay or compensation for their work at with Salvagings Teens At-Risk, Inc and North Texas Collegiate Academy.  Each member brings experience and wisdom to the table.  But most importantly, they love our schools and our students.
Board Members
Paula Kelley, Board President
            Dr. Pamela Peak, Board Secretary
Mrs. Martina Van Norden, Member
Dr. Felecia Pittman, Member
