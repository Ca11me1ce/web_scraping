Description
The Kindergarten Education Enrichment Program (KEEP) is open to students currently enrolled at a Legacy Traditional Schools campus in kindergarten. KEEP offers an educational enrichment opportunity for kindergarten children during the part of the day that they are not attending regular kindergarten class. The program is fee-based and enrollment is based on a first-come, first-serve basis. KEEP is independent of any other program. KEEP begins on the first day of school and ends on the last day of school. There is a monthly fee for the KEEP program.
Waiting List Program
Children will be placed on a waiting/pending list. If there are openings available, families will be notified within 2 weeks that your registration has been accepted. If there are no current openings, your child will remain on the waitlist. Once an opening becomes available, you will be notified by the campus. Contracts are approved within the order in which they were received.
