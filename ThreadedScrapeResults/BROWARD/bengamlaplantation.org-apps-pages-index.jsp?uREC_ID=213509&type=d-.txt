												Accreditation									
Ben Gamla is accredited by SACS (Southern Association of Colleges and Schools).
AdvancED is the unified organization of the North Central Association Commission on Accreditation and School Improvement (NCA CASI), Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Council on Accreditation and School Improvement (SACS CASI), and National Study of School Evaluation (NSSE). AdvancED is dedicated to advancing excellence in education through accreditation, research, and professional services.
This unified organization creates the world's largest education community, representing 23,000 public and private schools and districts across the United States and in 65 countries worldwide and serving nearly 15 million students. The inclusion of NSSE brings to schools and districts greater access to NSSE's products, services, and strong research base on the factors that impact student learning.
The creation of AdvancED is the beginning of a new journey in the century-long histories of NCA CASI, SACS CASI, and NSSE. Through AdvancED, NCA CASI and SACS CASI will transition from setting standards for their respective regions to establishing unified quality standards for education in a global society. In essence, the transformation is from regional accreditation to a global system of accreditation, continuous improvement, and research.
NCA CASI and SACS CASI schools also share a unified, clear and powerful accreditation process designed to help schools continuously improve. Schools and school districts began use of the AdvancED standards and accreditation process in the 2007-08 school year.
