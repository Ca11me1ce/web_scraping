Somerset Achievements
Sofia Vasquez Receives Congressional Honors!
Sofia Vasquez, was one of 50 youth leaders that  received congressional honors from the most senior US Representative from Florida’s 27th congressional district, Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen last Friday, April 20th. Rep. Ros-Lehtinen has always admired the work these young people do for so many of South Florida’s underserved communities that she could not let her tenure end without giving praise and attention to their work one last time. Sofia was recognized for her years of service with the Joshua Heart Foundation. She has been a volunteer since she was 8 years old and a board member since she was 11. “Its so wonderful and admirable to see how much she’s grown and done at such a young age”, said Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen.
Joshua’s Heart Foundation (JHF) was founded in 2005 in Miami, Florida by Joshua Williams when he was four and a half years old and is dedicated to the fight against global hunger and poverty. JHF is a 501(c) 3 not-for-profit youth run organization, which empowers needy people to improve their quality of life by providing necessities like groceries and personal items. They also effectively engage and educate young people in committing to fight hunger and poverty on a global basis. JAB Members recognized for their year in service, those who have supported or contributed to the mission in the past year/years.
