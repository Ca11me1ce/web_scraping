												The National Independence Day Parade									
																						Home

														We’re pleased to announce that Somerset Academy was nominated by Mayor  Frank C.  Ortis from the City of Pembroke Pines to represent the state  of Florida at one of America’s most important and prestigious events:  The National Independence Day Parade in Washington, DC on July 4, 2018!  We are the only marching band representing FLORIDA!
The  Panther Marching Band was selected based on its impressive merits  including consistently placing 1st at regional competitions for the past  5 years, State Finalists for the past 5 years, Superior rating  adjudication results, overall quality, and geographical/ethnic/stylistic  diversity.  We have participated in district and state competitions  since 2009 through the Florida School Music Association, Florida  Marching Band Competition and Florida Band Masters Association. 
In  order to make this esteemed event a reality, your help and generosity  is greatly needed.  Your monetary donation would help us represent our  school, our community and our State on July 4th!  On this 5-day trip,  our band will not only march in the parade, but they will also tour  Smithsonian Museums, visit National landmarks and experience the  National Symphony Orchestra at the 4th of July Fireworks Celebration.   This is definitely a trip of a lifetime!
You can help  make this unforgettable experience happen for our students by generously  donating to help fund this trip on our PayPal link below!
We  would like to thank you in advance for supporting this amazing  endeavor.  Your help will make a significant impact to the Somerset  Academy Panther Marching Band Program!
