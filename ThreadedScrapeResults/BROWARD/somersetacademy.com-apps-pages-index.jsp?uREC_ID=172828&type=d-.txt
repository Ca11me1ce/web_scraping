Welcome to Somerset Academy's Virtual Curriculum Fair.
Message from the Principal 
As principal of Somerset Academy Charter Middle, High and Arts Conservatory School, it gives me great pleasure to extend to all our new and returning students, faculty, staff, and community a warm welcome to our school. Somerset Academy is one of the premier high schools in Broward County with a rich tradition of excellence. Since its inception in 2001, Somerset Academy Charter School has consistently provided educational excellence to its diverse student populace. Our greatest assets have been our educators, whose commitment and dedication to Somerset is evident in the value our parents and students hold for them. 
The Curriculum Bulletin is designed to assist parents and students select the appropriate courses for the next school year. As you read the bulletin carefully, you will find a comprehensive selection of both required and elective courses to choose from. Hence, the subject selection process enables us to offer a diverse curriculum while meeting graduation requirements. Although we will do our best to place your child in their preferred courses of interest, it is critical that your child chooses a fourth and fifth alternative in order to guarantee their needs are met to the best of our ability. 
As your pricipal, I am committed and determined to provide our students with a safe and challenging environment. Our administration and staff will continue to hold high expectations to be met by our students. It is in the spirit of meeting this challenge, that I invite all of our parents to partner with our students, their instructors, coaches, guidance counselors and administrators in collaborating to help pave the path to the endless new horizons of greater student achievement. I personally look forward to seeing all of you at our school functions throughout the year. 
Sincerely, 
Mr. Bernardo Montero 
Principal
