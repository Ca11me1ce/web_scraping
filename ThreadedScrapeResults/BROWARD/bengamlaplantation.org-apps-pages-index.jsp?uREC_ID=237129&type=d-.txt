Elementary Curriculum
Ben Gamla Charter Elementary follows the Florida Standards for ELA and Mathematics and the NGSSS standards for Science and Social Studies.
The Ben Gamla mission as well as the Ben Gamla Charter indicates that we are a Hebrew language Charter school.
  We are proud to offer Hebrew language to each grade level beginning in Kindergarten for 40-50 minutes daily depending on the grade level.
  Along with language, Israeli culture, traditions, and history are taught and integrated into the regular curriculum, wherever possible. Girls from Israel spend a year in our school as part of their service to their country.
  They teach song, dance, and geography to our students in order to instill a love of their country in our students.
Physical Education is offered to both Elementary and Middle School by a certified PE teacher several times per week depending on the grade level.
Ben Gamla Charter School follows the Broward County Schools Progression Plan. For information on promotion/graduation, please see:
