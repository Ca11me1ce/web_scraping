Dear Ben Gamla Families,
It is hard to believe that we are just about half way through this year. Timeflies when you have an amazing group of students, staff and a community that issupportive beyond words can express. 
I would like to express my gratitude for all of the volunteersthat have been contributing their free time to support the school throughoutthe 1st semester. The greatest thing about a charter school is theparent involvement. I truly love watching the children’s faces light up whentheir parents come to a school event.  Ittruly takes a village and I am thankful for those parents who are involved intheir child’s education whether it be through volunteering or by simply makingsure that they are in tune with the children’s academics. Parents are the mostimportant factor in the success of a child as they are a child’s first teacherand we call on our parents to help us encourage every child to strive to reachtheir best each and every day. 
While on the topic of parent involvement, we have anexciting event coming up next week. Save the date for our Annual World Showcase next Thursday, 12/21/17. Come by and see whatcountry your child has learned about this month as they make their presentationto you in their classrooms. You can then join your child as they all experiencesome special things about Israel which will take place in the cafeteria. Allgrade levels will be presenting at different times so make sure that you checkour website and the World Showcase flyer sent home last week to check for yourchild’s presentation time. We are so excited and cannot wait to enjoy this daywith all of our parents, students & staff.
A quick reminder to please look out for our re-registration dates as well as new registration dates which will bestarting at the end of January. The dates will be decided and posted on ourwebsite very soon. Ben Gamla South is expanding and we would love to bring inas many friends and family members of our current students as possible. Pleasespread the word about all of the amazing things that happen in our classroomsdaily! Our teachers do an incredible job each and every day for our students. 
During this holiday season, I hope that all of our familiesenjoy their celebrations with their loved ones in good company and in goodhealth. We are looking forward to welcoming our students back on Tuesday,January 9th and having an amazing second semester to come! 
Happy Holidays and a Happy New Year to all!
With Love,
Mrs. Cardoso
