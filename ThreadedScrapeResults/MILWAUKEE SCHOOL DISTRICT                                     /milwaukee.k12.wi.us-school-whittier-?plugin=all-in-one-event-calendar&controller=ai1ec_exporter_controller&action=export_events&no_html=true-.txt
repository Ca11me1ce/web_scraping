“School Quality Review: Now and Beyond”
Monday, March 19, 2018
Pulaski High School – Room 212
4:30 – 6:00 p.m. 
The “School Quality Review (SQR) Process” is a qualitative needs assessment rooted in the Essentials of School Improvement framework, spearheaded by the Departments of School Transformation and Innovation Development in the Office of Innovation and Information.
Join us for an interactive session to learn about the SQR and where the district is headed in this process. Presenters will give an overview of the SQR Process, along with the results from spring and fall 2017, and how they fused the SQR results to the Essentials of School Improvement framework. Attendees will be given the opportunity to provide feedback on the key elements of the process, focusing on critical data elements that tie into each essential highlighted.
