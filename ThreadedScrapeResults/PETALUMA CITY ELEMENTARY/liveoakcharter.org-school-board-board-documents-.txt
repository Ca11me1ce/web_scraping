Our School
Live Oak is a Waldorf inspired public charter school serving families in Sonoma and Marin counties. Our program is designed to support the holistic development of our students throughout their childhood, from Kindergarten through eighth grade. 
Live Oak offers a classical liberal arts program that honors the creative and intellectual gifts of our children. Through Interdisciplinary scholarship, creative arts, and a positive school culture, our students are prepared for high school with confidence, proficiency, and imagination.

In the Spirit of Community
"A healthy social life is found when, 
in the mirror of each soul 
the whole community finds its reflection,
and when in the community 
the virtue of each one is living"

Charter Documents and Reports
Charter Document
Live Oak is a
 tuition free public charter school.  Live Oak is governed by its own local school community through its own independent board, rather than our chartering district. This arrangements allows for greater program innovation, oversight and responsiveness for our students, teachers, and families.
The foundation document of our school is the Charter.  The Charter document outlines the mission, pedagogy, and methods we use to meet educational needs of our children, and satisfy both state and local mandates.  The Charter is renewed every 5 years with our chartering agency, Petaluma City Schools. The charter is attached below.  
Board Policies
Board 
policies
 Including Bullying, Student Conduct and Sexual Harassment are posted below.  
SARC
Student Accountability Report Cards are annual reports presented by all Public School in California.  The SARC is drawn from local and state data sources to summarize the school's performance over the previous year.
Prop 30 Resolutions
The adoption of Proposition 30 led to the creation of the EPA (Education Protection Account). EPA Funds are restricted to appropriate use.  The annual declaration by the board directs the expenditure of such revenues.  The Board resolution is posted here for public access.
