Our School
Live Oak is a Waldorf inspired public charter school serving families in Sonoma and Marin counties. Our program is designed to support the holistic development of our students throughout their childhood, from Kindergarten through eighth grade. 
Live Oak offers a classical liberal arts program that honors the creative and intellectual gifts of our children. Through Interdisciplinary scholarship, creative arts, and a positive school culture, our students are prepared for high school with confidence, proficiency, and imagination.

In the Spirit of Community
"A healthy social life is found when, 
in the mirror of each soul 
the whole community finds its reflection,
and when in the community 
the virtue of each one is living"

Community  Giving

Volunteer
Live Oak Charter is known for its strong parent support.  We would not be able to offer our program at Live Oak were it not for the incredible dedication and support of our community.  Each year over 6,000 hours of time are donated by our community; the equivalent of 3 full time staff. In addition to providing labor, our volunteers also offer their expertise and artistry.  From web designers to painters, cabinetmakers to fiber artists, our parents and friends are able to bring their professional experience and knowledge in support of our school.  Volunteering is a way to meet new friends, develop relationships with kindred families, and demonstrate to your children the benefit of being actively involved in building a community.  
Live Oak uses Volunteer Spot to coordinate our volunteer efforts.  Please visit our sign up page to see upcoming projects and needs.
