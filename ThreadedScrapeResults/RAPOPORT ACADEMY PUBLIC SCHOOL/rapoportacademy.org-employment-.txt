What Kind of Teachers Are We Seeking?
Interested in teaching at Rapoport Academy? We are looking for teachers who are:
Passionate: Our teachers are committed to the profession of teaching and passionate about the content they teach. They bring energy and enthusiasm to the classroom every day—their students can't help but be excited about learning.
Student-Centered: Our teachers are here to serve students. They do whatever it takes to reach a diverse set of learners in their classroom. They are also willing to pitch in whenever needed, from sponsoring student clubs to serving in the lunch line.
Self-Motivated: Our teachers take initiative and are constantly trying to be better at what they do. We do not use a scripted curriculum, so teachers have the flexibility to design and deliver lessons in ways that fit their teaching style and their students' learning styles. This means that our teachers must be motivated to be creative, try new things, and learn more about the art of teaching.
Collaborative: Our teachers are members of a team. They support one another, plan together, strategize in groups, and pick each other up. Our teachers do not treat their classroom as their kingdom—they are always looking for ways to share resources and ideas to make everyone better. Our teachers plan lessons that cross content boundaries so that concepts are reinforced between classes and learning stays relevant and engaging.
Flexible: Our teachers are committed to continuous improvement at the classroom and campus levels. We are always developing innovative approaches to meet the needs of students. Innovation means change, and our teachers adapt easily to change.
