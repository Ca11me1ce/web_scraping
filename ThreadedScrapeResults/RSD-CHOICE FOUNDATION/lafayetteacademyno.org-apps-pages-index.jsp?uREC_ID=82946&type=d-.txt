												How to Apply									
Lafayette Academy welcomes applications for students in grades Pre-K through 8.  All we ask is that you are committed to preparing your child for a college preparatory education. 
The Application process at Lafayette is a quick and easy two-step process:
1.) Complete the Recovery School District's common application process for the 2014-2015 school year and submit to the Lafayette School office. 
2.) Complete the Lafayette enrollment package.
Please include all contact information for both parents, grandparents, and any additional family members - the more ways we have to get in touch with you, the better. 
**Both forms are available for download at the bottom of the page**
