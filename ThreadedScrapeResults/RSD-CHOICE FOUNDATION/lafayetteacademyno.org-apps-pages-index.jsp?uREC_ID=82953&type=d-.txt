Testing Schedule
Tips for Parents
LEAP
Each year, students in grades 3 through 8 take state tests to measure their knowledge and skills in each subject area and their readiness for the next level of study. The LEAP tests are just one of several indicators, in combination with report cards, teacher-made tests, and classroom work, that are used to create a complete picture of a studentâs performance in school.
The results from the tests will be used to help teachers identify when students need additional support or more challenging work in each subject area. This information is also used to measure how well schools are helping students achieve higher expectations. Students will take the following tests in grades 3-8:
English language arts (ELA)
Mathematics
Science
Social Studies
Students in grades 5 through 8 will take the LEAP tests in ELA, math, science, and social studies online. Students in grades 3 and 4 will take the LEAP tests on paper. The LEAP tests are strictly timed, and no additional time is permitted except for students who have a documented extended time accommodation.
Online Test Schedule
The online testing window is from April 9th to May 4th. A final schedule for each grade will be determined by the school in early March.
Paper-based Test Schedule
The paper-based testing for grades 3 and 4 will take place from April 30th to May 4th. The tests will be given according to the following schedule:
