Fine Arts: The arts are integrated into  Lafayette Academy curriculum and include visual arts and music.     
Technology: Technology is used daily as part  of the curriculum. Each classroom has at least five computers set up for  students to use.  We have a spacious technology center equipped with 24 Dell  computers loaded with both professional (Microsoft Office) and child-friendly  educational software applications. Students visit the technology center  regularly as part of their coursework.  Laptop carts equipped with 30 laptops  are located on the 2nd and 3rd floors for teachers to utilize in the  classroom.
