FJA Middle School (5th-8th)
The FJA Middle School offers a one-of-a-kind educational experience for your 5th-8th grader. As the only middle school in west Flagstaff, FJA offers small class sizes, individualized academic attention, a unique blend of core-curriculum and electives, a full sports program, and outdoor leadership.
FJA Middle School believes that students learn by experiencing and immersing themselves in the curriculum. You might find an FJA Middle School student hiking up to Observatory Mesa for an outdoor classroom experience, taking a learning adventure to Catalina Island, riding a bike to Grand Canyon, conducting field experiments in the adjacent Frances Short Pond, wrestling against teams from all over the state, carefully crafting an award winning piece of art, or performing a play at the Coconino Center for the Arts.
At FJA Middle School, we strongly believe that our students should face high school and the rest of their lives with a well-rounded education. While we agree that test scores are vitally important,we also understand that a school’s success should be measured in many ways, including how happy and satisfied its students and parents are.
Come visit FJA Middle School and enjoy the difference!
