Notification of Rights Under FERPA for Elementary and Secondary Schools The Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) affords parents and students over 18 years of age (eligible students) certain rights with respect to the student’s education records.
These rights are:
The right to inspect and review the student’s education records within 45 days of the School receiving a request for access. Parents or eligible students should submit to the appropriate school official a written request that identifies the record(s) they wish to inspect. The school office will make arrangements for access and notify the parent or eligible student of the time and place where the records will be inspected.
The right to request the Amendment of the student’s records that the parent or eligible student believes are inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of the student’s privacy rights under FERPA. Parents or eligible students who wish to ask the school to amend a record should write the school principal, clearly identify the part of the record they want changed, and specify why it should be changed. If the school decides not to amend the as requested by the parent or eligible student, the school will notify the parent or eligible student of the decision and advise them of their right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the parent or eligible student when notified of the right to a hearing.
The right to consent to disclosures of personally identifiable information contained in the student’s education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. One exception, which permits disclosure without consent, is disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests. A school official is a person employed by the school as an administrator, supervisor, instructor, or support staff member (including health or medical staff and law enforcement personnel); a person serving on the School Board; a person or company with whom the school has contracted as its agent to provide a service instead of using its own employees or officials (such as an attorney, auditor, medical, consultant, or therapist); or a parent or student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting another school official in performing his or her tasks. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibility. Upon request, the school discloses education records without consent to officials of another school district in which the student seeks or intends to enroll. [Note: FERPA requires a school district to make a reasonable attempt to notify the parent or student of the records request unless it states it is annual notification that it intends to forward records on request.]
The right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by FJA to comply with the requirements of FERPA. The name and address of the Office that administers FERPA are: Family Policy Compliance Office U.S. Department of Education 400 Maryland Avenue, SW Washington, DC 20202-5920
Notice for Directory Information under FERPA The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), a Federal law, requires that FJA, with certain exceptions, obtain your written consent prior to the disclosure of personally identifiable information from your child’s education records. However, FJA may disclose appropriately designated “directory information” without written consent, unless you have advised the District to the contrary in accordance with District procedures. The primary purpose of directory information is to allow FJA to include this type of information form your child’s education records in certain school publications.
Examples include:
A playbill, showing your student’s role in a drama production
The annual Yearbook
Honor roll or other recognition lists
Graduation programs
Sports activity programs, such as wrestling, showing weight and height of team members
Directory information, which is information that is generally not considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if released, can also be disclosed to outside organizations without a parent’s prior written consent. Outside organizations include, but are not limited to, companies that manufacture class rings or publish yearbooks. In addition, two federal laws require local educational agencies (LEAs) receiving assistance under the Elementary and Secondary Educational Act of 1965 (ESEA) to provide military recruiters, upon request, with three directory information categories- names, addresses and telephone listings- unless parents have advised LEA that they do not want their student’s information disclosed without their prior written consent. If you do not want FJA to disclose directory information from your child’s education records without your prior written consent, you must notify FJA in writing by January 1st.
FJA has designated the following information as directory information: [Note: an LEA may, but does not have to, include all information listed below.]

FJA will directly notify parents of these policies at least annually at the start of each school year and after any students who are scheduled to participate in specific activities or surveys noted below and will provide an opportunity for the parent to opt his or her child out of participation of the specific activity or survey. FJA will make this notification to parents at the beginning of the school year if FJA has identified the specific or approximate dates of the activities of surveys at that time.
For surveys and activities scheduled after the school starts, parents will be provided reasonable notification of the planned activities and surveys listed below and be provided an opportunity to opt their child out of such activities or surveys. Parents will also be provided and opportunity to review any pertinent surveys.
