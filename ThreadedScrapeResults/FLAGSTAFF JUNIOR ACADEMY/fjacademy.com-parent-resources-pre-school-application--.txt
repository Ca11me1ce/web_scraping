CHILDREN’S HOUSE SCHOOL FINANCIAL POLICY
Please read, agree to and sign this statement BEFORE your child is admitted to any of the privately funded programs we offer.
The COMPLETE registration packet must be submitted before a space can be reserved for your child. We reserve the right to give your space to others until the COMPLETE registration packet is in our hands.
Our annual tuition is developed on the basis of an academic year budget. We have adopted a monthly payment convention because most people cannot afford to pay the annual tuition amount all at once. Each of the monthly payments has been calculated as a fraction of the academic year tuition. You are not paying monthly for that month, but for a fraction of the academic year. We do not refund tuition, therefore, for school holidays, absences, or snow days.
Once registered, your child is enrolled in the school until s/he disenrolls. We do not accept “drop-in” unregistered children in any program. For this reason, we cannot make refunds for absences. Because we operate at or near capacity, neither can we permit you to “make-up” absences by attending at some other time than that for which you originally enrolled.
A $25.00 late fee is added to your account whenever your monthly payment is made beyond the grace period.
Checks returned to us for insufficient funds carry a $25.00 returned check fee.
Persons who make arrangements to pay late or who make arrangements to make smaller than monthly payments must be on time. In cases where these agreements are not kept, late fees may be charged. We regret that we must dis-enroll children whose parents repeatedly delay or fail to make schedule payments.
A finance charge of 1.5% per month will be charged on accounts delinquent over 60 days. The charges will accrue until the full amount due is collected, whether voluntarily or through the intervention of a collection agency or the court system.
We offer a discount for multiple children from the same family who are enrolled in one of our privately funded programs. You will not be granted a discount on private preschool tuition if you have a child in the charter school and a child in the preschool. Also, we cannot afford to grant multiple discounts to the same person. You will be granted whichever single discount is most advantageous to you. Individuals receiving the annual discount will forfeit the discount if they unenroll their child before the academic year ends.
Students whose state required immunizations are not complete will not be enrolled at the school.
I,________________________________,have read, understand and agree to the above policy. I understand that I am fully responsible for the annual tuition charged for the program in which I have enrolled my child. I agree to pay all costs and expenses incurred should my account be turned over for collection, including any legal or attorney fees. I understand that customary collection agency fees are at least 40% of the original debt.
