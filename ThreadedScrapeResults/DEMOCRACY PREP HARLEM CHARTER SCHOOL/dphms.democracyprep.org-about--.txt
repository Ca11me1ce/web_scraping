DPH is modeled on Democracy Prep’s flagship school, Democracy Prep Charter Middle School, the number one public middle school and number one charter school in all of New York City on the 2010 Chancellor’s Progress Report. Graduating eighth graders will now go on to attend our newly opened Democracy Prep Harlem High School, where they will continue on their path to success in college and citizenship
