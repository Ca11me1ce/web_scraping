BAKER WEB ACADEMY
BAKER EARLY COLLEGE
Baker Web Academy is a FREE, home-based schooling option for Oregon kids. Add educator home-visits to premium-quality curriculum choices and you’ll see how Baker Web Academy focuses attention where it should be — on your child’s education!
Baker Early College students attend local community college campuses fulltime for FREE and earn high school and college credits. We offer tuition, book reimbursements, and support to high school students in the state of Oregon.
Our Story
The Baker Charter Schools are two public charter schools (BWA & BEC) sponsored by Oregon’s Baker School District. The schools were founded in 2008 and have experienced exponential growth since then, as students all across the state have enrolled to take advantage of the flexible curricula and study-at-home programs that we offer.
We are not as big as the online schools that are part of a corporate, for-profit online education business, but we are big enough to leverage really great curriculum and employ a cadre of very talented, Oregon-certified teachers.  Students access classes and online teachers at home, in the case of the Web Academy, and at their local community college campus, in the case of the Early College.

"I got to be the coach..."
I have to say that the biggest change when we enrolled Anna was that now I wasn't the only adult monitoring her progress.  I didn't have to grade her work, so for once I got to be the coach, shoulder-to-shoulder with my daughter and helping her when she needed it.  So that was great, to have someone besides me pointing out places where her writing needed improvement, etc.  And the math program they had for her was phenomenal; very hard, but very good.  Just what she needed.
They encouraged her to take a couple of high school level classes as an 8th grader, and she earned A's in both of them.  So those went on her permanent high school transcript.  It's been a great program for her.

Is BWA right for you?  
Home-based learning isn’t right for every student. The following situations may help you explore whether BWA may be a good fit for your family.

Middle School
"When my parents started telling me about home-schooling as an option, I was only like "meh." I liked my 5th grade but what I was hearing about 6th grade wasn't all that great, and everyone talks about how horrible middle school is. But I kept wondering if I'd keep in touch with my friends and if it would be too hard.
The thing is, the other homeschooled kids I've met are really cool, too.  At our Bend BCS Student Center they do LEGO robotics and other activities, and that's where I meet up with some of the other guys that are in Baker Web.  Plus, I get to travel with my dad sometimes, and since I do my schoolwork wherever, it's no problem.  I like it."

Happy
"My daughters were having an awful time at our local elementary school.  I don't think it was anybody's fault, it's just a big school and they were falling through the cracks.  
We kept asking if they had any homework, and the answer was always "no."  It seemed like they weren't really growing academically or being challenged, but I didn't feel like I could take them out and do the whole homeschool thing.
A friend told us about Baker Web Academy and we signed up last fall.  The girls don't love it all the time, but they don't want to go back to school--and we've asked.  They love their math program, all three of them have started to read more and enjoy it, and I love having them home with me."

We've got a track that works for students in any situation.

How can I possibly catch up?
Violet had home-schooled with her parents since middle school started and they decided that studying at home would be a better option. Now Violet was midway through high school and had no officially recognized credits toward graduation requirements, but she realized that it's important to have an Oregon Diploma.  What to do?
Students come to BWA in this situation all the time. We are pros at getting “credit deficient” students set up for graduation success!
We were enrolled immediately!
Students who are waiting on Baker Web Academy’s waiting lists are always welcomed in at the start of each semester (August and January), and many times there is room in our regional student rosters for new students to join later. At some point in 
each semester, we implement waiting lists in some regions, but we’ll make room for you as soon as the next semester restarts.

I want to go to college next year!
If you have taken rigorous classes at your high school but you haven’t graduated yet, Baker Early College can help you get started at the local community college while you continue to make progress toward your high school diploma. We have even had students FINISH a two-year degree at their community college and having the “problem” of scheduling a double graduation: walking to get a high school diploma on one stage and then receiving the Associate’s degree diploma two weeks later.
Middle school pains - I really hate going to my middle school! 
Middle school tends to be a tough time for kids, but schooling at home with Baker Web Academy is a perfect answer for many families. We provide the curriculum and a laptop for your student to do his/her schoolwork on, and you get to be the one cheering from the side and helping your student manage workflow and time usage.
