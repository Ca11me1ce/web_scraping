Retirement Programs
EFC encourages all benefit eligible team members to participate and invest according to their retirement goals and to seek professional advice when making their retirement investment choices.
STRS/PERS Retirement Systems. EFC team members participate in the State Teachers’ Retirement System (CalSTRS) or Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) benefit. These are mandatory retirement programs in which team members are automatically enrolled. In conjunction with the team member’s contribution, EFC also provides an employer contribution to these retirement systems.
403(b) Retirement Program. A 403(b) retirement plan, also known as a tax-sheltered annuity (TSA) plan, is the not-for-profit equivalent of a 401(k) used in many corporate settings. EFC team members have the option of contributing into a 403(b) plan and have several providers from which to choose.
Flexible Spending Accounts
Education for Change offer Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA) for health and dependent care. Health FSA may be used for the reimbursement of eligible medical expenses for you, your spouse or dependents. Dependent Care FSA can be used to reimburse a participant for eligible dependent care expenses.
EFC also offers a Commuter Benefit Program. WageWorks Commuter is a pre-tax benefit account used to pay for public transit-including train, subway, bus, ferry, and eligible vanpool – as part of your daily commute to work.
Additional EFC Paid Insurance
