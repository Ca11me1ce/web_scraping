Accelerated Growth
90% of the children who enroll at EFC qualify for free and reduced lunch; many are academically already behind when they first enter our schools.  We therefore focus intensely on accelerating  growth to  ensure our children are prepared for college, career and life.   We are not where we want to be with respect to our academic performance but our schools are making steady progress and outperforming comparable Oakland district and charter schools.
