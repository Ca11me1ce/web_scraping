NOCCS History
Ten years ago, a diverse group of parents and educators began meeting in North Oakland living rooms and coffee shops to share a dream of starting a new school.  As we talked about our childrearing experiences, we saw that we were inspired by our young children’s sense of wonder and curiosity about the world they were beginning to explore.  We asked ourselves how we could design a school that respected and nurtured that magical sense of delight and engagement with the world.
With this in mind, we asked each person to envision sitting in a classroom of our future school.  What would they see?  What would children be doing and talking about?  What would the teacher be doing? How would the classroom arranged?  What kinds of student work would be on the walls?  As we talked and shared our thinking, our school design began to take shape, culminating in 
NOCCS’s 10 Core Principles.
With this set of guiding principles in hand, our founding parents set about the next 18 months tackling the countless tasks of setting up a new school, including hiring a teacher, finding a site, buying books and supplies, and most importantly, writing and presenting our charter petition to the Oakland Unified School District.
Oakland Unified School District awarded our charter in spring 2000 and we opened a one-room Kindergarten/1st grade school that fall.  Our goal was to become a Kindergarten-5th grade of 100 students.  Over the next six years we moved, added classrooms, and welcomed new teachers, families, and students.  We saw students graduate and go on to be successful middle schoolers.  New families brought new energy and ideas, helping enrich and strengthen our community.  We had growing pains, of course, but we always faced our challenges with honesty, hard work, and a commitment to NOCCS’s founding vision. 
In 2006, the incredible hard work and fundraising efforts of a visionary group of NOCCS parents made possible what very few charter schools have accomplished--we purchased and renovated our current building. This has allowed us, as of the fall of 2010, to fully expand to a K-8 school with a total enrollment of 215 students and their families as well as begin to set down roots as an important institution in the Longfellow/Linden Park Neighborhood Area.
While most of NOCCS’s founding families have departed when their children graduated or moved away, the founding vision of a school that supports powerful teaching and learning and nurtures what Eleanor Duckworth calls "the having of wonderful ideas" and is still thriving. Our families carry the flame that was lit a decade ago; the same flame that future families will keep alive in years to come. 
In just ten years, NOCCS has clearly maintained a record and built a climate and educational program that supports high academic achievement.  CST, API, and AYP data all point to a school that ranks among the very best that Oakland and Bay Area has to offer.  Our internal assessment and performances of understanding confirm and extend this notion and serve to remind other public schools of the importance of demonstrating skills and understanding through multiple measures and modalities.  NOCCS’ curriculum, while always a work in progress, is one example of how schools can thoughtfully organize and incorporate a range of the best educational practices to create an active, engaging, and powerful course of study for students from Kindergarten through the middles grades.  Our school climate and culture is strong and positive, with plentiful buy-in and commitment from our multiple and diverse stakeholders.  
Likewise, NOCCS has a track record of strong governance and operations.  The NOCCS Board of Trustees has worked to ensure an excellent and well supported educational staff by recruiting a highly experienced corps of teachers and an exciting school director who continue to lead the school towards an era of continued growth and sustainability that will continue to distinguish NOCCS as a model of progressive urban public education and excellence.
Now, more than ever, public education needs real life examples of how to effectively educate children to occupy and lead a dynamic and interconnected world.  Within NOCCS, we believe we help to answer this call as we seek to continue to educate students and work collaboratively to benefit our student, our community, our city, and beyond.
