Personalizing Learning at Ascend

Ascend is piloting an innovative program involving flexible learning environments and multi-age instruction!
Here is a photo from week one:
Back in March of 2015 the 
Rogers Family Foundation
 awarded a grant to Ascend and several other Oakland schools in order to support the design and implementation of a new personalized learning model. The grant is a part of the Next Generation Learning Challenge mission to prepare students for success in higher education.
We are looking forward to learning more as students explore new learning environments and create new community norms.
Here is a photo of Ms. Zeolla’s class getting in tune with their senses in the garden during a poetry session!
