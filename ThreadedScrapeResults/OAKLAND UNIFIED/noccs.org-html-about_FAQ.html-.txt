What is a charter school?

Provides a high quality public education choice for students and families
Enables change-oriented educators to establish and operate new, innovative practices

How is NOCCS Funded?
As a California charter school, NOCCS receive state and local funding in a per student allotment. This allotment is based on statewide averages, dependent on the grade level of the students.
NOCCS also receives state and federal funding through categorical programs like Title I or class size reduction.
A portion of our funding comes from the generous contributions from individuals and private foundations.
Our school also raises approximately 10% of its annual budget through the tremendous fundraising efforts of the students and families in our community.  We raise approximately $100,000 annually through a variety of initiatives such as the NOCCS Walk-A-Thon, Annual Fund, and Auction.  To help to support out on-going fundraising efforts,

How is NOCCS governed?
	NOCCS is an independent charter school and is governed as a public benefit ("not-for-profit") 501(c)(3) corporation.  Our 
Board of Directors
 is ultimately responsible for all aspects of our fiscal and legal governance, operations, and compliance.  Our board, along with our charter granting agency, Oakland Unified School District, are responsible for ensuring we are meeting the terms of our 
current charter
.
Does NOCCS provide special education programs and services?
	Yes. As a public school, NOCCS is required to follow federal laws pertaining to special education (e.g., Section 504, Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act (IDEA), and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). As such, we operate as our own Local Education Agency (LEA) and run our special education programs as a member of the El Dorado Charter Special Education Local Plan Area (SELPA). As our own LEA, we ensure that we provide a free and appropriate education for children with special needs identified in an individualized education plan (IEP) or 504 plan.	
Does NOCCS employ credentialed and "NCLB Highly Qualified" teachers?
	Yes, all core subject matter teachers at NOCCS are highly qualified, credentialed teachers.  The California Education Code Section 47605(l) provides that, "Teachers in charter schools shall be required to hold a Commission on Teacher Credentialing certificate, permit or other document equivalent to that which a teach in other public schools would be required to hold." In addition, the law states that "It is the intent of the Legislature that charter schools be given flexibility with regard to noncore, noncollege preparatory courses", as such some of our specialists, while they are not credentialed, have specialized education and training in their areas of expertise.
