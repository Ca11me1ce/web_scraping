Family Involvement
Volunteering at NOCCS
Community Partners
Family Involvement
We believe it takes our entire community to educate our children.
Each family is asked to volunteer a minimum of four hours a month of service to the school.  Most families give much more than the minimum.  In fact, in an average school year, NOCCS families volunteer a total of over 7,000  hours!
NOCCS families provide a wide array of services that draw on their many talents and interests.  Examples include:
Serving on the NOCCS Board of Trustees or Board committee
Serving lunch
Teaching visual arts 
Assisting in the classroom or office
Coordinating fundraising projects
Providing tech support to the school
Developing a school library
Helping us "green" our school
Gardening
And much more!
Our parent volunteer coordinator works to match each family member with a volunteer task that fits their interests, skills, and work schedule.  Our familiesâ€™ contributions enrich our school and help us strengthen connections between school and home.
