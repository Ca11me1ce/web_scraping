Professional Development
Professional Development
Our entire staff participates in extensive professional development throughout their tenure at NOCCS.  We begin each school year with a full week of professional development.  Throughout the school year, staff members participate in a minimum of 160 hours of site-based professional development.  In addition, many staff members participate in addition professional development over the summer and throughout the academic year.  Many of our teachers have participated in Harvard University’s Project Zero Classroom Institute, including several staff members who have worked as Teaching Fellows within the program.          
Like our educational model, our professional development programming is focused on leveraging the individual strengths, knowledge, skills, and leadership of our staff members to enrich the collective work of the learning community.  As such, we work to build the leadership capacity of each teacher so that our staff members can take on leadership and coaching roles with one another to move our educational priorities forward.  For example, over the summer two of our staff members restructured and wrote our Year A Peacemaking Curriculum Guide – this work included planning and facilitating a number of training and work sessions related to effectively implementing the curriculum; during our summer institute, a team of four teachers led a number of workshops related to reflective practice, thinking routines, and other practices related to Project Zero Classrooms; one of our teachers trained the entire staff on culturally relevant instructional protocols and has worked as a consultant to her peers who need additional support in this area; and a team of our staff members led the efforts to revise our progress reports resulting in a brand new format.  Our professional development programming also utilizes a number of best practices for strong professional learning communities, such as the use of protocols to guide the development and peer-review of curriculum, examining student work, coaching models, and the use of teacher inquiry.
