About Us
Space Center
Lakeview Academy is the number one space simulator program in the world.  Mostly because we say so, but also because we have found the best ways to make them enaging and curriculum based.  We have 3 space ships in our fleet.  UCS Leo and our two newest ships UCS Apollo and UCS Artemis.  Students have the priviledge of using these 3 learning tools during the school day as part of their STEAM and hands-on enhancement experience.  The teachers of Lakeview Academy work with the flight director to write engaging dramatized missions that incorporate the learning objectives of each grade level.  We feel this learning experience will not only help students better retain and demonstrate mastery of required standards, but will also help them more fully grasp the mission of Lakeview Academy by becoming more Capable, Confident and better able to Contribute in society.
