Volunteers
The active participation of parents is vital to the success of Lakeview Academy. We believe that most parents seeking a charter school understand and have a strong desire for more involvement in their childs education. In general it is expected, that our parents volunteer of their time to be actively involved in the school.
For volunteer opportunities, please contact your teacher. The school will send out an email to all families when volunteers are needed for school wide events. 
Please remember, when volunteering, we ask that you do not bring younger children as this tends to be a distraction for the other students.
