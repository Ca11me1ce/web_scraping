Child Find
Federal law mandates the provision of free-educational programs and/or services for persons with disabilities between the ages of birth and twenty-one. If a child is having significant difficulty with vision, speech, hearing, behavior, is experiencing slow development untypical for his/her age, physical impairments, or learning difficulty, he/she may be a child with a disability.
If you know of any child whom you feel might qualify for these services, including students suspected of having a disability even though they are advancing from grade to grade, in a private school, homeless, or migrant, please contact the Director or the Special Education Director at 801-331-6788.
