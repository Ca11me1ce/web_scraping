The 2018-2019 Course Catalog Has Arrived
It’s here! Our brand new 
2018-2019 PALCS Course Catalog
 has arrived and is now available to either 
download as a K-12 .pdf in its entirety
 or 
browse by grade on our website
. We are excited to provide families with a comprehensive catalog that lists all requirements, courses, and programs offered next school year.
PALCS teachers develop their own unique courses, deliver instruction, make and grade assignments, and interact with students on a daily basis. Teachers are readily available to assist their students and provide individualized feedback on their work. Screenshots of lessons and a general description of a school day can be found on our 
school demo page
.
As a backbone to these lessons, our curriculum meets or exceeds all Pennsylvania Core Standards. PALCS faculty members review curriculum from different publishers and then select what materials work best for our students in the cyber environment. Materials are selected from multiple publishers, such as McGraw Hill, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Glencoe, Pearson, Discovery Education, Holt McDougal, Cengage, and more. Additionally, our courses utilize the fullest extent of supplemental educational resources available on the Internet.
We are currently accepting 
applications
 for all students in grades K-12 for the upcoming 2018-2019 school year. New student orientations will begin this spring and continue throughout the summer. Our first day of school will be Tuesday, September 4, 2018.
Download your very own PALCS Course Catalog today
 to see why the 2018-2019 school year will be our best yet!
