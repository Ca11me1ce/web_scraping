By continuing to browse and use this website, you are agreeing to comply with and be bound by the following terms and conditions of use. If you disagree with any part of these terms and conditions, please do not use our website.
The use of this website is subject to the following terms of use:
The content of the pages of this website is for your general information and use only. It is subject to change without notice.
Neither we nor any third parties provide any warranty or guarantee as to the accuracy, timeliness, performance, completeness or suitability of the information and materials found or offered on this website for any particular purpose. You acknowledge that such information and materials may contain inaccuracies or errors and we expressly exclude liability for any such inaccuracies or errors to the fullest extent permitted by law.
Your use of any information or materials on this website is entirely at your own risk, for which we shall not be liable. It shall be your own responsibility to ensure that any products, services or information available through this website meet your specific requirements.
This website contains material which is owned by or licensed to us. This material includes, but is not limited to, the design, layout, look, appearance and graphics. Reproduction is prohibited other than in accordance with the copyright notice, which forms part of these terms and conditions.
All trade marks reproduced in this website which are not the property of, or licensed to, the operator are acknowledged on the website.
Unauthorized use of this website may give rise to a claim for damages and/or be a criminal offense.
From time to time this website may also include links to other websites. These links are provided for your convenience to provide further information. They do not signify that we endorse the website(s). We have no responsibility for the content of the linked website(s).
Website disclaimer
The information contained in this website is for general information purposes only. The information is provided by PA Leadership Charter School and while we endeavor to keep the information up to date and correct, we make no representations or warranties of any kind, express or implied, about the completeness, accuracy, reliability, suitability or availability with respect to the website or the information, products, services, or related graphics contained on the website for any purpose. Any reliance you place on such information is therefore strictly at your own risk.
In no event will we be liable for any loss or damage including without limitation, indirect or consequential loss or damage, or any loss or damage whatsoever arising from loss of data arising out of, or in connection with, the use of this website.
Through this website you are able to link to other websites which are not under the control of PA Leadership Charter School. We have no control over the nature, content and availability of those sites. The inclusion of any links does not necessarily imply a recommendation or endorse the views expressed within them.
Every effort is made to keep the website up and running smoothly.  However, PA Leadership Charter School takes no responsibility for, and will not be liable for, the website being temporarily unavailable due to technical issues beyond our control.
Privacy Policy
PA Leadership will NOT use any gathered information for anything other than marketing our school to interested parties. Your information will only be accessed by PA Leadership employees.
The PALCS Privacy Policy differs for non-enrolled families versus enrolled families. The information in this document regards families who have not yet enrolled in PA Leadership who are using our public palcs.org website.
Passive Tracking (cookies)
Some of the code on the PALCS website will place a small, non-malicious file on your computer called a cookie, which will gather information about your use of our site. You may remove your cookies and browsing history at any time. Each web browser that you use to access web pages has a slightly different method for clearing your cache (“cache” being the collective term for temporarily downloaded web page content and snippets of code like cookies.) Here are examples for popular browsers like 
Chrome
 and 
Firefox
. You can learn more about cookies and online advertising at the 
Network Advertising Initiative
.
We use 
Google Analytics
 on palcs.org to monitor the flow of traffic to, through, and from our website. We use this to see trends on our site over time. Google Analytics will place a cookie on your computer to gather this information. None of the information stored in the cookie or relayed to us is personally identifiable. This information is available to a very small team of PALCS information employees and marketing partners at 
PennLive
. 
We also use 
HubSpot
 to track the same usage behaviors on our site as Google Analytics, but will not be personally identifiable unless you decide to provide further information. This may be through form information filled out on palcs.org (as explained in Active Data Entry below) or if you call, visit, email, or meet us at an event and provide your information. Once you decide to provide further information, your usage of the palcs.org website may be linked to your name or other voluntarily provided information.
We use Google Remarketing to show you PALCS advertisements on other non-PALCS websites in the Google network. This is done by way of a third-party DoubleClick cookie. Any targeted marketing you see online will be based on computer algorithms. We will not personally identify you and contact you unless you actively enter your information.
Active Data Entry
Information you personally enter on our website is for internal use only. We will never sell or release your personal information. Please note: release of school records is for enrolled students and not covered under this document.
Information entered on a palcs.org form will be hosted in an external database on 
HubSpot
, backed up in another external database, 
SalesForce
, and eventually passed to an email platform, 
MailChimp
. The information stored on these external sites is encrypted and is only accessible by the small team of PA Leadership information employees. We will use this information, combined with Passive Tracking data, to better determine your interest in the school and contact you only about PALCS. We will not track your activities off of our palcs.org website, though we may be notified when you open or interact with email from us.
If you decide you no longer wish to be contacted by PA Leadership, please call us at 610-701-3333 ext. 1212.
