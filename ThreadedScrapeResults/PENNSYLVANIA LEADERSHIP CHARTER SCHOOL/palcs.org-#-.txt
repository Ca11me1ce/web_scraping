Our Families
It allows students to become independent learners while still having support from teachers. Our children have made a lot of good friends across PA by getting involved in things like Student Government, field trips, chats, the School of Professional Studies, school dances.

The teachers here, despite the fact that you don’t see them every day, go out of their way to help you. I have met so many wonderful people from these programs and have gotten to participate in so many fun trips and volunteer/leadership activities.

Our kids participate in more social activities at PALCS then they would if they were are a typical brick and mortar school. Nick even attended a virtual field trip to Africa last year, it was truly amazing!

More from Colleen Ellison, parent
I am loving it! I love having control over my schedule, my teachers are so friendly, and my guidance counselor is so helpful! I like the flexible schedules and the fact that it is the #1 PA Cyber school for SAT scores and in PA’s top 100 schools.

The twinkle in Sammi’s eye is back and she understands the content and does not feel lost. Kaleb and Kaylene are building wonderful relationships with their teachers and feel comfortable reaching out to them for help.

More from Carey Manternach, parent
With PALCS, you are a person with individual needs, successes and goals. It was the absolute best thing for me. PALCS allowed me to learn my own way and I have been successful. I’ve developed great friendships with many students from PALCS classes.
