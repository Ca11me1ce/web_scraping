A Quality School
At Summit High School, we are a team of dedicated professionals working to raise the bar in public education. By continually challenging ourselves, we strive for continuous improvement toward a common goal: to assure every student achieves to his or her own unique potential.
Our school is distinctive, designed specifically to meet the existing and emerging needs of our community. Yet, like all Leona schools we share in these hallmark characteristics:
High expectations for academics and behavior 
Personalized student attention 
Caring, highly qualified teachers 
Hands-on, relevant learning 
Safe, nurturing environment 
​
We warmly encourage parent involvement and also work to establish lasting partnerships with community organizations. This combination of caring and high standards surrounds our students, parents and staffs – and excellence in teaching and learning is the result.
Students leave our school with a solid foundation for learning, taking their first steps toward a lifetime of success. Our goal is for each one of our students to graduate well prepared for his or her next step in life. Whatever they choose, we want them to thrive as individuals as well as members of their families and communities.
