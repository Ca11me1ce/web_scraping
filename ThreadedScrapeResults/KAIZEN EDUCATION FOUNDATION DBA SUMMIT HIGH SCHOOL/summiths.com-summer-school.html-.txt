Students are able to participate in one class per session. Perfect attendance is required for students to receive .5 credit for a class. All students will receive a FREE BREAKFAST and LUNCH daily. Classes are a total of ten days - Monday-Friday. Please mark the classes you wish to attend. Classes are held from 8 a.m. to 2:35 p.m. (lunch: 11:30 a.m. to 11:50 a.m.). Each class will be FREE!  Discipline issues will not be tolerated, and students involved in discipline issues will be removed.  It is recommended that non-Summit High School students bring in an unofficial transcript, so we can recommend a class.
