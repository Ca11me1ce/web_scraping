Our Mission and Vision
Summit High School’s Mission and Vision is to provide a safe and nurturing environment for a diverse student body.  In this setting, we aim to promote scholastic success with student-centered instruction, challenging curriculum, and high academic standards.  We offer credit recovery, flexible scheduling, and remediation to assist students in achieving their educational goals. We inspire curiosity through technology integration, the arts, and extra-curricular activities.  These practices are put in place to encourage students to graduate from high school, make positive post-secondary plans, and become productive members of their community.  
Arizona State Board for Charter Schools Mission Statement:
The mission of Summit High School is to help all students develop basic skills, understanding and attitudes necessary to become productive citizens. We accomplish this through an integrated approach using curriculum aligned to the Arizona State Standards and relevant instruction. The school serves young people for whom traditional schools have not been effective and predictably will not be in the future. As such, essentially all students meet one or more of Arizona's definitions for an alternative school. That is, they have behavioral issues, have dropped out or are likely to drop out, are pregnant or parenting, have a history of academic failure or have been adjudicated. It is the specific mission of the school to serve such students.
