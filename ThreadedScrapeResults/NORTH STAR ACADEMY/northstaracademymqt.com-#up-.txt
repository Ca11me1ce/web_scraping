We're Different
We're A Charter School
North Star Montessori Academy offers parents and students a small, personalized and project based learning environment that is tuition free.
Environmental Focused Instruction
One of the most important things we can teach our children, is to learn from and protect the world we live in.
Project Based Learning
North Star incorporates learning through the process and enjoyment of project building.
Independent Schools
Charter schools are independent public schools that are open to all students, regardless of income, gender, race or religion. Fifty-eight percent of charter school students are minority and 52 percent are eligible for free and reduced-price lunch.
Involvement
Charter schools hold students, teachers and parents accountable for improving student achievement.
Tax Funded
Charter schools run independently of traditional school districts, yet since they are public schools they are funded by tax-payer money. Charter schools have their own school boards.
What We Offer
North Star Montessori Academy is a Preschool through 12th grade charter school, authorized by Northern Michigan University. 
North Star Montessori Academy is a public school chartered by Northern Michigan University, serving grades Preschool - 12.
Many charter schools are helping to close the achievement gap for low-income and minority students. For many students and parents, charter schools are providing quality options and raising the bar in public education. North Star Montessori Academy strives to raise this bar in Marquette and the surrounding area.
