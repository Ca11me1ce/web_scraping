WCS Charter
Strategic Plan
Westlake Charter School is a K-8th grade public elementary school created by parents and educators in Natomas. We opened our doors in 2005 and continue to grow serving more and more students each year. WCS’s primary mission is to demonstrate what is possible when school and community collaborate to create inspiring adults with the academic and social-emotional readiness to lead as Global Citizens.
Westlake Charter School students are EXPLORERS! Our curriculum focuses on diversity and appreciation of different cultures, while promoting academic excellence and foreign language acquisition. We offer various specialty classes to all of our students including Art, Physical Education, and Spanish. Our middle school program focuses on Math, Science and Technology and is executed through the use of technology. Westlake Charter School has small class sizes of approximately 22-24 students in K-3rd grade and 29 students in 4th-8th grade.
First time visitors to Westlake Charter School often remark, “What a warm and inviting school!” Creating a school that is caring and open is absolutely critical in working successfully with our children and families. Students who feel safe, secure, and appreciated gain a love of learning and will be successful scholars.
Westlake Charter School’s professional staff is relentless in seeking and trying research-based best practices that engage every student. Our lessons are hands-on and differentiated to meet the diverse needs of all students. Our teachers display a never-ending commitment to improving their own expertise. Furthermore, we would not be as successful without the support and involvement of our parents. Our parent group is outstanding in helping us achieve our goals by volunteering their time in class, fundraising for our unique programs, and providing endless words of encouragement and support. Our school team is second to none!
