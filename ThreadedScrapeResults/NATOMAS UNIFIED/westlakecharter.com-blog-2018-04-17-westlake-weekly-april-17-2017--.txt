Celebrations
We sent over 50 middle school students to Discover Law Day at McGeorge School of Law to explore what a career in law could look like – students participated in a mock class, mock trial, campus tour and more. 
Natomas High School drama students performed “The Day the Crayons Quit” play for our kindergarten and 1st grade students. 
Our 2nd grade students met their challenge to have safe bodies every day on campus. Because they learned to have safe bodies on campus, they earned a play date! Way to be safe, Explorers.
