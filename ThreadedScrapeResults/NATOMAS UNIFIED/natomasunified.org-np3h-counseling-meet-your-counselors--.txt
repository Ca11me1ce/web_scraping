It’s a Pirates life for me! Hello and thank you for taking your time to learn a little bit about me. I was raised just a stone’s throw from Sacramento in the countryside of Davis. After high school I studied Sociology, Social Welfare and Photography earning a Bachelor’s of Arts from The University of New Mexico. I began working in private schools focused on early childhood education through early elementary grades. Returning to California in 2000 with two little children, I began studying for a Master’s of Science in Counseling with both School Counseling and Marriage, Family and Child Counseling specializations. While in Graduate school I began working in San Juan Unified School District, through the Whitehouse Counseling Center, and continued as a provider in Sacramento Children’s Mental Health Services through Dignity Health for another 8 years. My Pirate life began many years ago when I was searching for middle school options for my oldest son and learned about NP³ from other parents while on the soccer field sidelines. My oldest son graduated from NP³ High School in 2015, and my youngest son graduated in the NP³ Class of 2017. I am so fortunate to be able to work at the same school I chose for my own children and look forward to many more years aboard this fulfilling adventure.

Hello Pirates! I was born and raised in Turlock, California. When I am not at NP3 , I enjoy spending time with my family and loved ones. This is my second year as a Counselor at NP3. I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Psychology at Sacramento State in 2011. Shortly thereafter, I began my journey to earn my Master of Science degree in Counseling, specializing in School Counseling. While in Graduate school I interned at an Elementary and High School within the San Juan Unified School District. I also worked as a Migrant Education Advisor at the K-12 level in Yuba City, California. I graduated with my Master’s in the spring of 2015 and joined the NP3 Pirates that summer. I am thrilled to be a part of such a supportive team that strives to support students academically and personally. I look forward to continuing to watch our students grow and achieve their goals.

Ahoy, Pirates! A little bit about me… I attended Chico State, where I earned my Bachelor’s Degree in Business Marketing. I then decided to fulfill my dream of being an educator. I completed my Master’s Degree in Educational Counseling through National University in San Diego and then moved back up to Northern California, which is truly my home. I love to travel, learn, and hike, but trying new foods is one of my favorite hobbies (can it be considered a hobby?). I could not be happier to be a part of the NP³
Counseling Team
! Here’s to another amazing school year, Pirates!
