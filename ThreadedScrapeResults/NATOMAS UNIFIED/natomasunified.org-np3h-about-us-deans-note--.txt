Dean’s Note
I was born and raised in Sacramento and have a beautiful wife and two beautiful daughters.  When I am not devoted to improving NP3, I love spending time with my family traveling and being active.  I also have 4 nieces that I get to spend a lot of time with, watching them play soccer and softball.  I am truly a family man at heart.  After graduating from Sacramento High School, I attended Sacramento State University where I played baseball for the Hornets while earning my Bachelor degree in Kinesiology.  Following my time at Sacramento State, I quickly completed my teaching credential to begin my career in education.
This is my 14th year in education and I am proud to say I was one of the original 8 people who opened NP3 11 years ago.  I began as a teacher in both Biology and Physical Education at Laguna Creek High school in Elk Grove before transitioning to the same role at Sacramento Charter High School in 2004.  In 2006, I was fortunate to be part of a devoted group of people who opened NP3 High School,  becoming the first Physical Education teacher for NP3.  In 2015, I became the Dean of Students at NP3 and couldn’t be happier.  I am very proud of the positive culture and climate that we have built at NP3 and I am committed to maintaining that positive culture as the Dean of Students.  I love coming to work each day to be a part of these young people’s lives and watching each student grow both academically and personally.
I am very excited for the school year and am looking forward to continuing the great culture and family climate at NP3.
