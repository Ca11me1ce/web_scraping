Westlake Charter School
Westlake Charter School students are EXPLORERS! Our curriculum focuses on diversity and appreciation of different cultures, while promoting academic excellence and foreign language acquisition. We offer various specialty classes to all of our students including Art, Physical Education, and Spanish. Our middle school program builds on the foundation of our elementary program, combines technology with project-based learning, and is committed to your student’s success. Westlake Charter School has small class sizes of approximately 22 students in K-3rd grade, and 26-29 students in 4th-8th grade.
Each grade level, K through 8, focus on a continent of the world to study. The continents of study are: Kindergarten – North America; 1st Grade – Antarctica and Australia; 2nd Grade – South America; 3rd Grade – Europe; 4th Grade – Asia; 5th Grade – Africa; 6th through 8th Grade students review all continents, take a closer look at global issues, and how they can individually make a difference in the world.
First time visitors to Westlake Charter School often remark, “What a warm and inviting school!” Creating a school that is caring and open is absolutely critical in working successfully with our children and families. Students who feel safe, secure, and appreciated gain a love of learning and will be successful scholars.
Westlake Charter School’s professional staff are relentless in seeking and implementing research-based best practices that engage every student. Our lessons are hands-on and differentiated to meet the diverse needs of all students. Our teachers display a never-ending commitment to improving their own expertise. Furthermore, we would not be as successful without the support and involvement of our parents. WAVE, our parent group, is outstanding in helping us achieve our goals by volunteering their time in class, fundraising for our unique programs, and providing endless words of encouragement and support. Our school team is second to none!
WCS’s primary mission is to prepare students with the skills necessary for life-long learning by providing a physically and emotionally safe learning environment that supports academic risk-taking, invites student participation and structures cooperative learning experiences.
Starting with the 2017/18 school year, Westlake Charter’s campus will be located at 2680 Mabry Drive, Sacramento, CA 95835.
Now that you know a little more about our program, we would encourage you to reach out and connect with us at either school campus, or through our Facebook and Twitter pages.
Community Service Opportunities for our Middle School students
Westlake Charter 6th-8th grade students are required to provide community service hours, and what better way to earn those hours than by working in our community! The City of Sacramento and Mayor Pro Tem Angelique Ashby’s Office offers community service and volunteer activities throughout the year, check them out!
