Our Commitment
The Natomas Unified School District is committed to providing a website that is accessible to the widest possible audience, regardless of technology or ability. We are actively working to increase the accessibility and usability of our website and in doing so adhere to many of the available standards and guidelines including the standards outlined in Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act.
Guidelines and Standards
This website strives to conform to level Double-A of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) 
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0
. These guidelines explain how to make web content more accessible for people with disabilities. Conformance with these guidelines will help make the web more user friendly for all people.
This site has been built using code compliant with W3C standards for HTML and CSS. The site displays correctly in current browsers and using standards compliant HTML/CSS code means any future browsers will also display it correctly.
