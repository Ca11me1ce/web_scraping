Testimonials
“The strengths start with the administration. I think the teachers do a good job of establishing a positive learning environment. And having just gotten back from Westminster Woods, I was really impressed at how good-natured the Westlake kids are. So I guess that means the school is strong at all those levels.”
Parent, WCS
“The education that my kids get is ten fold over other schools. The teachers are all so friendly and really have the kids’ best interests in mind.”
Parent, WCS
“These are the best teachers and administrators I have seen. They all are concerned about students and work hard to help them succeed. The parent involvement is impressive, too.”
Parent, WCS
“Communication and value of parent volunteers. The many opportunities available for volunteering really help parents stay involved with the school and their child’s education.”
Parent, WCS
“Staff are friendly and approachable. I love how the adults know each of the students. You can tell that the administration really cares about the well being and success of each student.”
Parent, WCS
“Excellent and motivated teachers and staff, small class sizes, differentiation of curriculum for each student, specialty classes, communication to parents, ease of ability to contact teachers and staff, parent involvement and volunteer opportunities, safety and respect for each student.”
Parent, WCS

How is Westlake Charter School Different?
Individualization
WCS is dedicated to providing a rigorous and challenging education for all students based on their individual academic and social needs. Through the use of student assessment data, Westlake Charter is committed to offering a learner-centered program that is focused on a project-based, thematic approach. 
Worldliness
WCS recognizes that we live in a world where national cultures are converging and civilization is becoming more interrelated. Our school strives to provide our students with the skills necessary to embrace cultural diversity and the mindset that they can make a difference in the world around them.
Technology
At WCS, we want our students to be excited about what they learn. Research shows that 21st century learners excel when their education is interactive, project-based, and relevant. At Westlake Charter School we look to move our classrooms beyond the confines of school walls with technology.
Specialties
At WCS we recognize that all students have different gifts and talents. We provide various experiences to help students discover and cultivate those talents. We recognize that education should go beyond the core subject areas. As a result, we strive to provide learning opportunities that are hands-on.
