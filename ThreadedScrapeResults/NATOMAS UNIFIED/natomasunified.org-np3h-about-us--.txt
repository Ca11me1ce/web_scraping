NP3 BELIEFS
Natomas Pacific Pathways Prep (NP3) Charter High School is a public charter school. Exposure to the fundamentals of the U.S. legal system is the theme around which our school is based. It was borne of a belief, in partnership with UOP’s McGeorge School of Law, that a small campus fosters an environment where educators can teach students to:
       Excel Academically,
       Use the parameters of Law as a basis for developing critical thinking skills
       Practice contributing to the Community-at-large.
Our diversity of students, the high expectations of our staff, our structure of extended classroom time, our sense of family and our attention to the development of each student are the elements that set us apart from other schools.
Vision:
NP
3
: A diverse, collaborative learning community where all students gain the knowledge and skills necessary to thrive as global citizens.
Mission
:
To graduate 
all
 students with high levels of academic and personal achievement through rigorous instruction and a collaborative system of support.
