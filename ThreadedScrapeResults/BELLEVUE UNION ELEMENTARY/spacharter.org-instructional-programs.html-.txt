Assessment
In anticipation of the new assessments with the Common Core Standards in 2014-2015, which are being developed by the Smarter Balanced Consortium (SBAC), as well as our implementation of RtI, we are transitioning with a hybrid model of assessments throughout this year. This includes a combination of traditional benchmark assessments, iStation, and writing assessments. 
CalServes
We are fortunate to have a wonderful partnership with CalServes for our after-school program. Their team of professionals, including AmeriCorps members, provides our students with programming to complement the instructional program during the school day.
