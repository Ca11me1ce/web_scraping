Happy Spring!
Finally we can see an end to winter storms and icy roads and think about the beautiful green landscapes and the fresh Wisconsin produce we crave all winter. Our May and June menus feature many fresh fruits and veggies as well as summer inspired meals such as our Food Truck Pork Nachos.
Do you have a favorite dish? We would love to hear your family favorites – we might even add it to our menu! 
Email your ideas
 or post it on our 
D.C. Everest School Nutrition Facebook Page
