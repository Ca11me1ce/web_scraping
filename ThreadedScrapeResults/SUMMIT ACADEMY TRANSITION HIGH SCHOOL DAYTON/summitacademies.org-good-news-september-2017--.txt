Middletown Secondary created a rock garden next to its main entrance to celebrate Linda Kranz’s book titled, “Only One You.”  The book is beautifully illustrated and contains sage advice from Adri’s mama and papa.  Simple and powerful, their wisdom comforts and guides Adri, and the book hopefully inspires parents and children of all ages as they swim through life.  The ELA teachers are working with students to paint a rock.

Akron Elementary received eight complete sight-word fluency helper packs (levels 1-3) that were donated by Different Avenues, Ltd., in Aurora, OH.  Different Avenues, Ltd. was started with one goal:  To develop a visually oriented, process-based blended learning system for both typical and atypical learners. With this donation, every K-3 and specialty classroom has access to the helper packs.  The total donation included 2,048 sight-word building videos, thumb drives, flash cards, and eight resource books.  Thank you, Different Avenues, Ltd.!

SafeHouse Residential Services in Youngstown held its second-annual Olympics on Thursday, September 7.  Events included a distance run; tire toss; free-throw shoot; bean-bag toss; 50-yard dash; football throw; and homerun derby.  For some students, the Olympics gave them the opportunity to simply hold a bat for the first time.  The events instilled teamwork and cooperation.  The stronger students mentored and helped those who needed a little assistance, and the direct-care staff joined in the event alongside our school personnel.  The kids enjoyed the day, and school personnel/direct-care staff enjoyed building a stronger rapport and strengthening relationships.

Canton Secondary partnered with Teachers Pay Teachers to “Adopt a Texas Classroom.”  Canton Secondary partnered with Aransas Pass High School in Port Aransas, TX.  Teacher Ashleigh Hancock (9-12 English/Language Arts/Reading) wrote Canton Secondary requesting help with her greatest needs:
<img class="wp-image-12552 alignleft" src="https://summitacademies.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/1605087_69789cc094ab48889b72e31b451de310-2-300x300.png" alt="" width="226" height="228" />
“My entire classroom library was ruined, so young-adult books would be awesome.  Also, a lot of my students left their five-subject spirals that we use for our INBs in my classroom, so those kids are without notebooks.  Any general supplies would help; most of my built-up stash is gone (like most teachers, I’ve spent years building up a surplus to be able to help my less-fortunate kids), and that whole supply is gone.”
Canton Secondary sent a letter to parents and guardians asking for donations of young-adult reading books, five-subject spiral notebooks, pencils, pens, tape, staplers, school supplies, and classroom decorations relating to English, Language Arts, and Reading.
Warren Community also adopted classrooms in Texas.  On September 1, students were invited to dress down and wear jeans and red, white, and blue.  In return for participating in dress-down day, students made monetary donations that were used to purchase Amazon gift 
<img class="size-medium wp-image-12563 alignleft" src="https://summitacademies.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/amazon660-300x196.png" alt="" width="300" height="196" srcset="https://summitacademies.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/amazon660-300x196.png 300w, https://summitacademies.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/amazon660-170x111.png 170w, https://summitacademies.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/amazon660.png 344w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />
cards for supplies.  The dress-down day was Warren Community’s first community service project of the school year.
Principal Allison Glass wrote to parents/guardians:  “Thank you for supporting our mission to always be kind and help those in need.”
In other Warren Community news, Principal Allison Glass on the first day of school walked a Kindergarten student home to ensure that he arrived safely, as he wasn’t sure he remembered his way.  Also, Corrie Rafferty shares that she visited Day 1 and reports that students were walked to their classroom by a member of the administrative team, including the Sensei.  Principal Glass was busy making sure all needs were me.  Teachers made a point to collaborate during mutual-planning time.
Canton Community also reached out to Adopt a Classroom via Teachers Pay Teachers and was paired with the Kindergarten class at Cravens Early

Childhood Academy in Houston.
Last Thursday and Friday, students dressed down for $1.  Several Summit families donated to the fundraiser, and Canton Community was able to send Kindergarten Teacher Ms. Graciela Najera $200 to help her students whose homes were flooded and whose families needed funds for backpacks, uniforms, and social/emotional books that may help her class understand what happened in their town.
Warren Secondary Principal Erin Bradley and her team have developed and nurtured a collaborative relationship with the Methodist church across the 
<img class="wp-image-12565 alignleft" src="https://summitacademies.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/methodist.png" alt="" width="80" height="180" />
street from the school.  This has resulted in multiple activities that are hosted by the church and it has facilitated collaborating on events.  This year, the church is providing a full week of team-building and communication-skill-building with all students.  These sessions will be one hour, and one grade each day will be served.
Also, kudos and thanks to Behavior Specialist Maria Winbush, who saw a student crying outside because she had a conflict with another student on her way home and returned to school.  Maria followed up, bringing the student into the building to process what happened and what to do next time.  Maria and others drew a map to get the student home and followed up with the Mom.
Summit Academy Youngstown’s first day of school started with smiles and beginning-of-the-year pictures.  The teachers were welcoming the students back and interacting with them, while the dedicated admin staff pitched in to do whatever was needed.

Day 2’s staff meeting saw Principal Mike Majzun and Assistant Principal Adrienne Achenbach pumping up the staff while reminding them of building protocols and also reinforcing the need to focus on the students.  Mike and Adrienne and the staff participated in sharing positive student stories from the first day.
Parma Community this year launched a Sunshine Committee as a way to show appreciation to staff.  The committee plans socials, organizes treat day, and 
<img class="size-medium wp-image-12570 alignleft" src="https://summitacademies.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/apples-for-staff-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://summitacademies.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/apples-for-staff-225x300.jpg 225w, https://summitacademies.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/apples-for-staff-103x137.jpg 103w, https://summitacademies.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/apples-for-staff-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://summitacademies.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/apples-for-staff.jpg 1224w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" />
gives appreciation gifts throughout the school year. This most recent appreciation campaign is one of several that Parma implements to continually show gratitude, and to keep its employees happy and energized on a daily basis.
The Committee’s latest undertaking is presenting “apples” to staff members who are nominated by staff, students, and parents.  The “apples” then are placed on a “tree” that hangs in the main hallway.  On Fridays, those who were recognized have their “apple” recognitions read over the loud speaker.  At month’s end, a random drawing is held, and the teacher whose name is selected receives the preferred parking spot of the “apple.”
