At KIPP Bay Area Schools, we rely on our community partners to provide our students with unique opportunities to help set them up for success through college and life. There are many ways to get involved through Career Readiness Programs, After School Programs and School/Administration Support.
Get Involved
Beautify Our Schools — Summer 2018
Lead or join a volunteer group in painting, clean up or classroom organization at our schools across the Bay Area this summer.
Host Students for a Day at Your Organization — November 2018
Our annual Career Day provides an invaluable opportunity for high school juniors to experience a professional workplace and to learn about various career pathways.
Visit a KIPP School
Join us for a one-hour informational visit at one of our KIPP schools. Guests receive a tour of the campus, experience a classroom lesson, and have an opportunity to meet our KIPPsters. 
Tutor at a School
Are you an individual or organization who wants to work one-on-one with a student on an on-going basis to provide them with skills needed to succeed? Our schools are looking for tutors for all subjects.
Introduce Your Friends or Colleagues to KIPP
Help us organize a lunch for your friends or co-workers at your home or workplace. These informational, hour-long presentations have been a valuable way to introduce and enlist a broader group of champions for KIPP.
Provide Our KIPPsters Virtual Support
Individuals can support our students virtually by assisting with resumes, college essays, interview help, etc. This provides our students a great opportunity to receive thoughtful feedback and strengthen their skills!
Become a Mentor for Our KIPPsters
Are you a young professional interested in mentoring someone at the beginning of their career? Do you have professional networks you’re willing to open up to a motivated young person? The KIPP Alumni Mentorship Program connects our upperclassmen in college and recent college graduates with professionals in their field. Our vision is to strengthen KIPP alumni’s social capital through relationship-building, networking, job shadowing, and strengthening basic professional skillsets. Contact 
Angela
 for more details.
Hire Summer Interns at Your Organization — Summer 2019
Each summer our Bay Area partner companies host recent KIPP high school graduates and college-aged alumni as interns, providing them with essential experiences to explore new career fields and build their professional network. Interns can conduct research, support operations, evaluate programs, design marketing material, etc.
