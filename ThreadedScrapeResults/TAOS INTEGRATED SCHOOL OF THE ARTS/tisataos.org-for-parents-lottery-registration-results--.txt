Taos Integrated School of the Arts is a free public state charter school, and admission is by open lottery. If you are interested in enrolling your child at TISA, you can call our office at 575-758-7755 to request an application, or download an application in English (see below).
Lottery Application 2018-2019
Lottery Drawing, Monday, April 16th (Computer Random Generator Program)
The lottery drawing will take place in the main office on the Bendix campus. The drawing is completed using an Ablebits Data random generated program directly on the computer. Phone calls to parents of applicants who made it on the class list will be called after the drawing on Monday into Thursday the 19th.  All applicants will also receive a paper letter in the mail to the address provided on the lottery application with information as to the applicants status. If the applicant has made it onto the class list, a form will be mailed out and needs to be filled out completed and returned to the mailing address provided or to the main office no later than the deadline.
Please note that not all grades will have openings and we do follow the approved sibling policy for students who are currently enrolled. Should we have more than one sibling apply for a single grade, a separate sibling lottery will be held for the open spots. We thank you in advance for your time and patience and we look forward to a new school year!
Lottery Application Process
Open lottery starts on Monday, March 5th. TISA will accept lottery applications for grades K-8. All incoming applications will be placed on a list based on the applying grade. The lottery is done randomly on the computer and will take place on Monday, April 16th, 2018. Enrolled students with applying siblings will occupy vacant spots first, based on the sibling policy. Should more vacant spots become available, students will be called according to order based on the randomly generated list.
Please note: The lottery application and waiting list are only good for the current school year. The open lottery takes place every year in March and closes in April. TISA will advertise through The Taos News, local radio stations, & the TISA website.
