                1st Grade              
First-graders extend their knowledge of language arts, learning skills that enable them to read and write more independently. By the end of first grade, students should read proficiently at grade level and have the ability to decode and recognize increasingly complex words accurately and automatically.

                2nd Grade              
For students in second grade, instruction focuses on developing literacy and proficiency in language arts with the goal that all students become lifelong readers, competent writers, and effective communicators. In mathematics, students become proficient in basic computational skills and procedures, develop conceptual understandings, and become adept at problem solving. Standards-based instruction also includes Science, History-Social Science, Visual & Performing Arts, Health, and more.

                3rd Grade              
Third grade is often considered a pivotal year as instruction in phonics is phased out of the formal curriculum and emphasis increases on vocabulary acquisition, comprehension strategies, text analysis, language conventions, and writing. A crucial goal is that all students leave third grade able to read fluently, effortlessly, independently, and enthusiastically.  In mathematics, third-graders deepen their understanding of place value and knowledge of and skill with addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of whole numbers.

                4th Grade              
Traditionally, fourth grade marks the transition from learning to read (in kindergarten through grade three) to reading to learn (in grade four and beyond). There is more focus on academic language as students learn and practice a range of strategies for acquiring vocabulary independently. They read a wide range of literature, study the structural elements of poems, analyze informational text, and learn to use evidence to support points in the text. In Mathematics, fourth graders perform multi-digit arithmetic.

                5th Grade              
Fifth-grade students read a wide range of materials, including literature from different times and cultures and informational text on grade-level topics in all subject areas. The emphasis is on students’ comprehension of complex narrative and informational texts.

                Drama              
The Drama program provides students with opportunities to gain confidence and build collaboration, public speaking, and social interaction skills as they develop a solid foundation in the theater arts. Through after school activities, students cover the California State Standards for theater education, and learn the basics of the stage, character development, and improvisational and performance skills, as well as to analyze and critique a wide variety of dramatic genres.

                English Language Development              
English Language Development (ELD) Standards are used in tandem with the Common Core State Standards to give our English Learners (ELs) what they need to acquire language and gain access to grade-level standards. The California Department of Education requires that ELs receive explicit ELD instruction (Designated/Dedicated ELD Instruction), grouped by proficiency level. ELs also need access to grade-level standards. CUSD teachers use research-based instructional strategies proven to be effective in helping ELs meet grade-level content.
