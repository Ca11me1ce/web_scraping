More than 1,600 people participated, providing thoughts, ideas, and questions for the district leadership.
Input from parents, staff and other community members is very important to us in Campbell Union School District. Working closely with our community is essential to ensuring that the needs of all students are met. 
In January, we added ThoughtExchange—a new, online way for our community to engage and communicate with us about our district and schools. 
See the results here.
