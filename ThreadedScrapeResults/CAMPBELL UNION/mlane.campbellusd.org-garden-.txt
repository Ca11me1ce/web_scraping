Garden
Located at the back of the campus, the garden provides students an opportunity to put their life science education into action. The garden was built by a partnership between Campbell Union School District and various community volunteer teams who believed in the importance of education outside the four classroom walls. Students and staff grow everything from tomatoes and zucchinis to basil and sunflowers, watching plants take root in the raised beds.
