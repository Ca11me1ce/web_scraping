Board Passes School Safety Resolution
Updated    
Wed, Apr 4th  
District Governing Board urges lawmakers to support greater school safety through increased funding and “common sense gun reforms.”
At their March 29 meeting, the elementary school district trustees passed Resolution 2017-18-25 calling on state and federal legislators to do more to bolster funding for services that support students’ mental, physical and emotional health and protect students from gun violence. 
“Gun violence on school campuses, while relatively rare, represents a particularly egregious and unacceptable threat to the lives of students, teachers, and staff across the country,” the resolution states.

District Governing Board urges lawmakers to support greater school safety through increased funding and “common sense gun reforms.”
At their March 29 meeting, the elementary school district trustees passed Resolution 2017-18-25 calling on state and federal legislators to do more to bolster funding for services that support students’ mental, physical and emotional health and protect students from gun violence. 
“Gun violence on school campuses, while relatively rare, represents a particularly egregious and unacceptable threat to the lives of students, teachers, and staff across the country,” the resolution states. 
Prompted by the February 2018 mass shooting at a Florida high school, the resolution cites data about bullying, harassment, and student access to guns, and it asserts students’ and staff’s rights to safety at school. 
The resolution also requests for adequate funding to support students social and emotional needs in addition to their academic achievement. 
“Our District partners with community health services to help students and families who need support with social-emotional and other non-instructional issues,” said Superintendent Shelly Viramontez. “The costs of educating and supporting students have been rising faster than state and federal funding, making it difficult to provide services that allow our teachers to teach while students get support for their social-emotional well-being.” 
A copy of the 
full resolution
 is available on the district’s website.

Marshall Lane is being recognized as a California Distinguished School
Updated    
Thu, Apr 5th  
In February, we were informed that Marshall Lane had qualified to apply for the prestigious California Distinguished School Award.  A small group of our school’s staff members, parents, district office staff members, and two consultants from the Santa Clara County Office of Education worked hard to write an application that highlighted some of the strengths of our wonderful school.
It is with great pleasure that we report to you that State Superintendent of Schools Tom Torlakson emailed us today congratulating us for earning the California Distinguished School Award.  This is a great accomplishment since it represents the hard work of all of our dedicated staff members, wonderful students, and amazingly supportive community members.  Congratulations to all!  Representatives will accept the award on May 3rd in Anaheim.

District Earns Award for Exemplary Attendance Program
Updated    
Wed, Mar 7th  
Parents and guardians are proving the adage about showing up being a big part of success for their children.
Engaging families as partners and refining how staff uses extensive attendance data has earned Campbell Union School District one of the highest attendance rates in California, improved student achievement, and a 2018 Hoffmann Exemplary School Program Award.
“We are making a difference together,” said Superintendent Shelly Viramontez. “Our approach allows us to systematically address attendance obstacles, maintain high levels of parent engagement, celebrate improvements, and provide an array of supports and resources to reduce the loss of instructional time.”

Parents and guardians are proving the adage about showing up being a big part of success for their children.
Engaging families as partners and refining how staff uses extensive attendance data has earned Campbell Union School District one of the highest attendance rates in California, improved student achievement, and a 2018 Hoffmann Exemplary School Program Award.
“We are making a difference together,” said Superintendent Shelly Viramontez. “Our approach allows us to systematically address attendance obstacles, maintain high levels of parent engagement, celebrate improvements, and provide an array of supports and resources to reduce the loss of instructional time.” 
This year, for example, the district and schools focused on lowering the rate of Chronic Absences through the relationships that the Community Liaisons have with families. 
“The personal connection is very important,” said Director of Student Services Rosanna Palomo. “Each absence, each tardy, and each early pick up is an opportunity for our school office staff or teacher to communicate with the parent about the importance of good attendance for their child’s success in school… and they do!” 
The results for early 2017-18 have been commendable, with a one-year attendance improvement rate of 67% among those chronically absent students. Other improvements include noticeable academic growth among the State’s student subgroups at CUSD schools with better attendance. Overall attendance gains can also generate savings to the district’s budget. 
The Glenn W. Hoffmann Awards, sponsored by the Santa Clara County School Boards Association (SCCSBA), celebrate school and school district programs that significantly impact student success in our region. The winners will be honored at a SCCSBA ceremony on April 25, 2018.
