Special Education
“The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) is a law ensuring services to children with disabilities throughout the nation. IDEA governs how states and public agencies provide early intervention, special education and related services to more than 6.5 million eligible infants, toddlers, children and youth with disabilities.”

According to the federal regulations that implement the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 2004 (IDEA ‘04) 34 C.F.R. § 300.602, SEAs are required to make the State Performance Plan (SPP) and the Annual Performance Report (APR) available to the public.
