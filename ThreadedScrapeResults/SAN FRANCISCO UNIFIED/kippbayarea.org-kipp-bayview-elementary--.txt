Mission & Vision
KIPP is committed to developing confident leaders who will use their education and life experiences to create positive change in their own lives, within their communities, and across our global society. We are proposing the creation of a new elementary school serving grades TK – 4 in the Bayview-Hunters Point neighborhood of San Francisco. At KIPP Bayview Elementary School, we will prepare our students to succeed in middle school, high school, college and beyond by developing in them the knowledge, skills, and character essential to thrive academically, shape their futures, and positively impact the world.
KIPP has experience and success working with educationally-underserved students and launching successful elementary schools that create a strong foundation for each child’s future. The school will partner with teachers, parents, community members, and the San Francisco Unified School District to accomplish its mission. The KIPP Bayview Elementary School is committed to broad community outreach to ensure that all potential families are aware of the option and know they are welcome and will be supported at the KIPP Bayview Elementary School.
Students who attend elementary school with KIPP will also have access to KIPP Bayview Academy (grades 5-8 and KIPP San Francisco College Preparatory (grades 9-12) as part of their journey to and through College. KIPP is proud to have been part of the Bayview community since 2003, and this school will enable us to work with students beginning even earlier to build a strong foundation for a lifelong love of learning.

School Leader
Ms. Allie Welch
There are currently 12 KIPP schools in the Bay Area. In these schools, over 5,200 students are being prepared for success in college and the competitive world beyond. These tuition-free, college-preparatory schools are located in the educationally underserved neighborhoods of Oakland, San Francisco, San Lorenzo, San Jose, Redwood City, and East Palo Alto.[/fullwidth]
What is KIPP?
KIPP is a non-profit network of college-preparatory, public charter schools serving elementary, middle, and high school students. We have a 20-year track record of preparing our students in educationally underserved communities for success in college and life.
At KIPP, teachers, students, and families are all united around the same goal—college graduation. Through our collective hard work and commitment, KIPP students complete college at a rate that is above the national average for all students and four times higher than students of similar economic backgrounds.
Today, there are nearly 200 KIPP schools in 20 states and the District of Columbia serving nearly 70,000 students on their path to and through college.
What Makes KIPP Different
We believe that all students can learn and achieve at high levels if given the opportunity. Our success is driven by:
High Expectations
Clearly defined and measurable high expectations for academic achievement and conduct that creates and reinforces a culture of achievement and support. We know that every student is different and we personalize learning based on a student’s needs, skills, and interests.
Strength of Character
Success in life depends on more than academic learning. We help students foster character strengths that are essential for their own success. And we empower them to express their voice and improve the world around them.
Highly-Skilled Teachers and Leaders
Great schools require great teachers and school leaders. We empower our school teams and invest in leadership and training rather than in bureaucracy.
Safe & Structured Environments
Physical and emotional safety is needed for students to take risks and learn from their successes and their mistakes. Our schools provide a safe, structured, and nurturing environment with minimal distractions so our students love school and maximize their learning.
KIPP Through College
Our counselors and advisors support students as they prepare for and select the right college for their needs and interests. After high school, we help KIPP alumni navigate the social, academic, and financial challenges they might encounter while in college.

Allie Welch has been working as an educator in the Bay Area for the past 7 years. Allie attended Stanford University and
graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in Public Policy and a secondary major in Economics. Her involvement during college with Breakthrough Collaborative San Jose solidified her commitment to working with students and ensuring that every student has access to an excellent education. Allie taught and led in Richmond, California. She was a Teach for America Bay Area corps member, teaching at a traditional public elementary school in Richmond. After teaching 2nd grade for two years at Nystrom Elementary, she started teaching at Richmond College Prep, a public K-6 charter school on the same city block.
During her fourth year of teaching, Allie participated in New Leaders’ Emerging Leaders program, leading the third grade team at the school. She then matriculated into New Leaders’ Aspiring Principals Program the year after. She had the incredible opportunity to stay at Richmond College Prep for her residency year, in an Assistant Principal role. She transitioned into a Principal role at the school for the 2015-16 school year and focused on putting in place structures for teacher collaboration and aligning the school’s curriculum and instruction to the Common Core State Standards. Most recently, Allie was part of Teach for America’s San Francisco team as a community coach for first and second year corps members who were teaching in traditional public and charter schools throughout the city.
Allie is excited and extremely grateful for the opportunity to be a Fisher Fellow with KIPP this year, working to open KIPP’s first TK-4 elementary school in San Francisco. She believes in the importance of a connected and inclusive school community for all students, families, and staff. A community in which students receive rigorous instruction around academics and socialemotional learning every day and are valued for who they are, and the strengths that they bring. Allie is also hoping to implement an integrated arts program as part of her vision for the school. Music played an important role in Allie’s own life – she played violin from age 3 through college and believes that the experience allowed her to develop important character traits that helped her to be successful in various school settings.
