Make a Gift
Support City on a Hill!
While a fully-grown City on a Hill school operates almost entirely on state funds, we rely on private gifts to supplement the operating budget of growing schools, to provide capital support, and to fund special projects and educational initiatives. With the help of generous supporters, City on a Hill has raised student skill levels, eliminated achievement gaps, and achieved 90%+ college enrollment rate each year.
Your tax deductible gift will help City on a Hill provide an education that has proven to be successful among urban high school students. We are grateful for your continued support!
