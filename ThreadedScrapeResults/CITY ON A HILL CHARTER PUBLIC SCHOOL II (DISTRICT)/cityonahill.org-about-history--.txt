Our History
1995
The original City on a Hill Charter Public School welcomes its founding students to the school’s initial location at the YMCA on Huntington Avenue in downtown Boston. CoaH is among the first charter schools to open in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
1998
City on a Hill graduates its first senior class.
2003
City on a Hill partners with Simmons College to develop the Urban Teaching Fellowship, an on-site licensure program designed to train effective teachers in urban public high schools.
2007
City on a Hill moves from its location on Huntington Avenue to its newly renovated current location at 58 Circuit Street in Roxbury.
2008
Tutorial is formally instituted in City on a Hill’s schedule and curriculum. All students now attend daily small group tutoring focused on honing math and English skills.
2013
City on a Hill Charter Public School II opens its doors in August 2013 in response to growing waitlists that indicated strong demand for additional educational opportunities in Boston. A replica of the flagship school on Circuit Street, CoaH II opens with a class of ninth graders and will grow one grade per year until it becomes a full 280-student high school in 2017.
2014
City on a Hill New Bedford  opens in August 2014, bringing CoaH’s proven model for success to one of Massachusetts’ high-need Gateway Cities. Similar to CoaH II, CoaH New Bedford will add a class each year until it reaches its full enrollment in 2018.
City on a Hill’s flagship school is officially renamed City on a Hill Charter Public School Circuit Street and City on a Hill II is renamed City on a Hill Charter Public School Dudley Square, reflecting their locations in the Roxbury neighborhood of Boston.
2017
City on a Hill Dudley Square graduates its first graduating class. City on a Hill Circuit Street graduates its 20th class.
