What is CoaHCORPS
The CoaHCORPS Tutorial Program is full-time tutoring program serving City on a Hill students in grades 9-11 with daily literacy and numeracy tutorials.
CORPS members commit to a year (Aug-Aug) of service at a City on a Hill school.  Members meet the students at their entering achievement levels and work to advance them beyond grade level.  As part of this program, City on a Hill provides an annual stipend as well as health and dental benefits, not to mention the experience of a lifetime!
CORPS members have a fixed roster of students that they tutor in small groups.
CORPS members’ responsibilities include:
Tutoring in either literacy and numeracy
Mentoring

Tracking and reporting student results
Helping with homework, teaching study habits, and reviewing course content
Facilitating extracurricular activities including Art Club, Drama Club, Creative Writing, Basketball, Yearbook, Cheerleading, etc. (additional stipend)
Other administrative duties such as lunch room coverage, modeling Sustained Silent Reading (SSR), staff assistance, and substituting during lunch periods
