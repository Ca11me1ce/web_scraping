Leadership
Sally Bachofer
 / Executive Director
A.B Bryn Mawr College, Ed.M Harvard University
Sally has spent her career working to support pathways for student, family, school and system success.  She joins us from her most recent position at City Year, Inc., where she served as their Senior Advisor, providing strategic counsel on City Year’s partnerships with schools and system leaders, K-12 education policy and internal network systems and operations management.
Previous to that role, Sally worked in New York State where, in 2010, the State Board of Regents appointed her as Assistant Commissioner of Education.  In that role, she was responsible for setting the Department’s new schools policy environment, leading school turnaround and re-design efforts, and oversight of the State’s over 250 public charter schools. In addition, she oversaw all school health and safety efforts for the 4,800 public school buildings in the State, and served as the Governor’s appointee to multiple statewide public safety and health task forces.
Sally has a deep connection to Boston and the larger charter school community, having lived and worked here for 12 years.  She spent time at the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education leading school improvement and school choice efforts, and was a member of the national staff at Expeditionary Learning Schools.  Sally started her career in public education with the San Diego Unified School District over 20 years ago.
