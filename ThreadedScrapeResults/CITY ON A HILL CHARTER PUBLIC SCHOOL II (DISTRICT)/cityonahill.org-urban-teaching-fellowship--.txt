Urban Teaching Fellowship
Program Overview
The City on a Hill Urban Teaching Fellowship is an on-site licensure program focused on training effective urban educators. The fellowship is a one-year program (beginning in late August) intended to train and license individuals interested in a career teaching in urban public high schools.
Fellows are trained and mentored by veteran City on a Hill teachers while taking graduate courses at Boston University toward a Master of Education (M.Ed.) degree. They receive a $20,000 stipend and significantly reduced tuition in exchange for teaching in an urban public school for two years upon completion of the program.
Applications for the 2018-2019 Fellowship Program are now available! We are still looking for Fellows in Science, and Spanish at both of our Boston campuses. Please apply on our 
careers page
.
Partnerships
Boston University Partnership 
City on a Hill has established a partnership with its neighbor, Boston University, that allows Teaching Fellows to receive a Master of Education (M.Ed.) degree by attending evening and summer courses during their Fellowship year and their first year of teaching.These courses are offered to Fellows at significantly reduced tuition, thanks to Boston University’s generous CoaH Scholarship.

required academic courses
City Year Career Partnership 
The Urban Teaching Fellowship is proud to be a City Year Career Partner. This partnership reflects the shared visions of both organizations and their belief that young people can keep students on track to graduate from high school and pursue post-secondary education. The City Year experience is a strong indicator of future success as an Urban Teaching Fellow; AmeriCorps members and alumni interested in continuing their commitment to education and student achievement are encouraged to apply.
