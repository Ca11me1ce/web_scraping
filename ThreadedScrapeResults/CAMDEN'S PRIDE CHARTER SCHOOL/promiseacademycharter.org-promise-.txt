Welcome to Camden’s Promise Charter School
Camden’s Promise Charter School is here to provide the youth of Camden with a successful educational experience. The school acknowledges that both family and community involvement is integral to students’ academic achievement level, and we focus on fostering strong partnerships between the school, family, and the community. Through these partnerships, the school strives to create a nurturing environment by providing each student with five fundamental resources deemed necessary for healthy child development by the President’s Summit for America’s Future. These include: a one-on-one relationship with a caring adult, a safe place to learn and grow, a healthy start, a marketable skill through effective education and a chance to give back to peers and the community.
