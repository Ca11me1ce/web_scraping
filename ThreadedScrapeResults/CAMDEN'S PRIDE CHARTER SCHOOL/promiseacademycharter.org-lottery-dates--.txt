Testimonials
"I have 3 children attending CPCS and have been apart of this wonderful school network for 5 years. They challenge and broaden your children's knowledge and aspire them to be the best. They also teach their students to be leaders through teamwork and community service. The workload is heavy but it prepares them for the college and surviving in the real world. I am happy with my choice to have my children attend CPCS."
