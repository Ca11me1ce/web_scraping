School Board
iSucceed School Board members are community members throughout the state of Idaho representing parents, business, education, nonprofits, law and innovation.  iSucceed Virtual High School, Inc. was founded in 2008 by a group of caring, concerned parents and community members came together to provide an alternative to traditional public schools. They had a vision to create opportunities enabling all Idaho students to achieve a high school diploma online, including under-served, minority, and at-risk high school-aged students throughout the state of Idaho. Since that time, iSucceed Board members are still dedicated to the mission and vision of the school to provide quality, individualized education to our students.
