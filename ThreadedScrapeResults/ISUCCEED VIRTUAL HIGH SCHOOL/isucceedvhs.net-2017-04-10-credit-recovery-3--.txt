Every year, 1.2 million U.S. students drop out of high school.
That’s about one in four high school students who will not graduate. Earning your high school diploma is extremely important. You can learn more in 
this article
.
If you’re thinking of dropping out, don’t. If you’ve already dropped out, it’s not too late.
A large portion of iSucceed Virtual High School students come already behind on credits. And each year, many former “at-risk” students go on to receive their high school diploma.
That means we can help you!
You Don’t Need a Credit Recovery Program to Graduate on Time
iSucceed is not a credit recovery program. A credit recovery program tends to consist of you sitting on a computer, reading documents, taking quizzes and passing the course.
If you failed your course the first time, why would you do better with hardly any support or guidance? That’s not what iSucceed’s about.
We are an accredited, public high school which means our courses aren’t easy. But we do have a few programs and personalized support that will make you more capable of catching up and graduating here at iSucceed than at another school. Learn more below.
How to Catch Up on Credits to Graduate
iSucceed’s academic structure helps students graduate on time or even early. You can learn more about graduating early 
here
. Our curriculum is separated into three courses every nine weeks. By the end of the traditional semester, a student at iSucceed will finish the same 6-7 courses a traditional student has; they just split it up differently.
Here’s how you can catch up:
After you successfully complete a nine-week block with iSucceed with passing grades, you are eligible to add on more courses. That means you can take three courses every six weeks for an additional three credits. That may not sound like much, but that’s six additional semester courses in the standard school year.
As a refresher, here’s how to catch up on credits with iSucceed:
Enroll with iSucced. Learn how to 
here
.
Successfully complete one block with iSucceed with good grades.
Get counselor approval to take additional courses.
Sometimes life circumstances can make it difficult to add on courses. If you are behind and unable to take on extra work, you can still earn your high school diploma. You can stay with iSucceed until you are 21. However long it takes you to finish high school is not important, so long as you do earn that accredited diploma!

Student Testimonials
Don’t just take our word for it. Here are a few other testimonials of online students who caught up on credits and graduated.
“I’ve had a rough high school career that put me in a bunch of different schools and left me behind in credits. Online school has helped me change that and was a great way to catch up and learn plenty of things on the way!
The way I finished was just realizing, I HAVE to do this. Don’t just drop out and give up after working for a couple years on it. Just be motivated and understand that having a diploma helps out a great bit in the real world…Good luck to all of you and understand that it’s all worth it in the end!”
-Joey Hergatt, Graduate
“My experience with online high school was great. I encountered credit problems at the beginning of my sophomore year, so my school recommended taking online courses.
At first I thought it was hard and that it needed a lot of focusing and dedication. Thanks to the help of all my teachers and student advisors, I was able to do so! I even became confident in asking for all the help I always needed, that’s how helpful and nice the teachers and advisors were with me.
Even though I came upon many conflicts and would fall behind on homework, the teachers always had a backup plan to help me move along and succeed. It offered a lot of flexibility!”
–Marianna Montes, Graduate
