What Our Students are Saying
“
I am grateful to all the teachers because they really care to help and are always very happy to help. It’s really easy to talk to the teacher with anything you are not understanding and need help. 
Esther Sanchez

“
My son has a diagnosis of Aspergers Syndrome and ADHD. What an incredible difference iSucceed has made! The teachers and his counselor communicate regularly, and I feel like we are a team. He is doing much better in school and his confidence has improved greatly! Our home is simply happier now. 
Michelle
Mom
“
My favorite thing about iSucceed was the flexibility of the schedule, because I was really into piano and really into music but didn’t necessarily have the time do that when I was in a brick and mortar school.

I did what I thought I couldn’t do… I graduated from high school! If it wasn’t for iSucceed being there throughout my struggles, I would have received a GED instead of an Idaho diploma.
