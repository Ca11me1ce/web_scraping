Parents and Teachers we apologize!! As t-shirt orders were being entered, we spotted a mistake on the order forms. We are offering sizes 2X, 3X and 4X in all t-shirt colors at $17.00 a shirt. If you need to order a t-shirt in any of these sizes, just add the size and color to your current order form OR if you have already turned your order form in, just write the size and color that you need on a sheet of paper with your child's name, teachers name and money attached. Again, we apologize for the inconvenience!! Thanks for all of your support!!

Today students took home a letter regarding Raffle Tickets. We ask that you disregard the 03/02/15 due date since they were to go home last Friday (snow day). Raffle tickets will be distributed this week so that you may take advantage over Spring Break to sell to family and friends from out of town. Starting the week after Spring Break, PTO will be collecting raffle ticket money on Mondays ONLY and will distribute more tickets on Wednesdays. If you have any questions regarding Raffle Tickets, feel free to contact Vonda Fulton at: 
432-978-4216 OR Vrfulton77@gmail.com  (date posted: 03/02/15)
We now have 66 days left!!! We will be sending home Spring Bash T-shirt order forms next week, so keep a look out for them. Please continue sending in your ideas on Sponsors. We will also be sending out information on the Car Show, the first of March as well. We are still in need of volunteers for the night of the Spring Bash. If you can help please let us know!
