EDUCATING TOMORROW'S
 LEADERS TODAY!
The present state of education in Arizona has been the topic of many emotional conversations and debates from dinner table to the classroom and to the State Capital. I am a teacher in a public school district in Tucson, and I understand the pressure to be a high performing school in the midst of obstacles such as low test scores, overcrowded classrooms and annually ideas on the best way to teach a child , et al. The Academy of Tucson has faced this challenge with a well-structured, rigorous program that builds upon itself to provide solid foundations the student will need in following years. Because of this attention to rigor, it would be detrimental to have my son attend a "normal" public school, as his depth of knowledge and academic skill level is far above and beyond that of Tucson's Public school system.
 My son has attended the Academy of Tucson for 4  years. Each of those years has been academically challenging for him and us but I am comforted by the fact that when my son leaves A.O.T., he will be better prepared for academic success. It is my opinion as a parent, and an educator, that the Academy of Tucson has created an "exceeds-level" system of educating our children.

My experience with the Academy of Tucson Elementary school has been very positive. Both my daughters attend the school, and I couldn't be happier with both the quality of their education and the environment. It's a small school, and the faculty and staff know all the students well. Students feel safe, are well cared for, and are encouraged to be good citizens. The teachers are top notch; there isn't one that I wouldn't be pleased to have as my child's teacher. The curriculum is rigorous, but the kids have a good time with the learning and both my daughters have done very well, even though each has a very different learning style. In addition to the "regular" class material, AOT has art, music, library, computers, and PE subjects that are often absent from the modern curriculum. I have no doubt that my girls are getting an excellent education, and the fact that they both love coming to school speaks volumes.

AOT is a one stop shop for schools! AOT has everything your child and my child need for success. My family and I can not say enough about the outstanding teachers, staff, and principal. Every child is looked at as an individual and appropriate expectations are placed for personal, emotional and academic success.  As a parent of a special needs child and standard child at AOT my needs as an advocate are always met, encouraged, supported, accommodated and respected. My husband and I are able to bee a part of our children's education by being a part of a team that's main priority is always our child. We are impressed by AOT's teaching staff and their expertise, knowledge, communication, and interaction with students. We as a family feel total comfort in knowing that our children have the privilege of attending a caliber of school that strives for and achieves excellence in children's education and their emotional well-being.

Academy of Tucson is the second school my children have attended. I regret to say I enrolled my kids in the first school as AOT is by far the best school I have seen. The academies are high quality. The students receive a private school education in this charter school. Each and every child walks away with a solid foundation not only academically, but in personal conduct as well. The environment at AOT is warm, friendly, safe, and that of a family. The staff is exceptional. They treat the kids with utmost respect. There is no talking down to the kids as I so often have found other places.

I cannot say enough about the Academy of Tucson Elementary School. It is a fantastic  school. I have 2 kids here and they love it. They look forward to going to school. It is such an honor to find a school that has 100% of my trust in all areas of my children's educational needs. Our experience for our entire family has been nothing but positive. The teachers and staff are highly skilled, motivated, and give 110%. I appreciate all they do. The curriculum is challenging and well balanced. I fully recommend this school for any and all children, Tucson's best kept secret.

We put our son in AOT after my wife did all the research around Tucson. The school staffs are friendly and always accessible. The teachers are very involved. The school is small and care enough for teachers/staff to know most students by names. I would highly recommend AOT to anyone.
