Director's Message
The Academy for Science and Design is advancing our mission of cultivating New Hampshire's future innovators in science and technology through the unique, personalized pathways we make available to our students.  Founded as a public Charter school in 2007, ASD has recognized the critical importance of providing New Hampshire students with a world-class education in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).
Our success in achieving these goals depends upon our students' experiences while enrolled at the Academy for Science and Design.  Our skillful teachers and challenging curriculum depend heavily on the availability of partnerships and cooperative arrangements with local employers and training organizations to provide opportunities for inspiring our students and preparing for them to succeed.  To this end, we call upon community members to join us in the mission to bolster New Hampshire's future workforce and to support the advancement of science and technology in our state.
Jennifer Cava is currently in her fifth year as the Director of the Academy for Science & Design.  She is a certified school Principal, holding an M.Ed in Educational Leadership from New England College, a MAT in Secondary English Education from Brown University, and a BA in English Language and Literature & Theatre Arts from Smith College.  Recently appearing in New Hampshire's "IT  List 2015," featuring the most influential individuals in the state, Cava brings a wealth of experiences from over a decade of teaching in various educational institutions throughout New England.
