New Hampshire chartered public schools are funded at a much lower level than 
non-chartered
 public schools: The New Hampshire Department of Education funds charter schools at a rate of $5597 per student while the average statewide expenditure for 
non-chartered
 public schools is $14,248 per student.
ASD is completely dependent on our Annual Fund to cover operational costs.  Last year's Annual Fund raised over $177,000+ which was fully utilized by the school to cover operational expenses.  The Annual Fund this year has the same fundraising goal. Thank you to the families who have already donated and to all of our families who will support the Annual Fund this year.
Your donation will make a very real and important difference to students at the Academy for Science and Design. Thank you for your support.
