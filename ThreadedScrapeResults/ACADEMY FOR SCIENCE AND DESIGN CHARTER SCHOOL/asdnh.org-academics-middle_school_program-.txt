Middle School Curriculum
ASD's Middle School, Grades 7-8, offers a challenging STEM based curriculum taught by a dedicated faculty. By requiring courses in mathematics, physics, technology design, aerospace, space science, environmental science, biology & chemistry, and computer science, ASD provides students with the opportunity to discover their passion. Students create meaningful real-world connections through problem-based learning, performance assessment, traditional classroom learning, and appropriate use of technology. Courses in English, social studies, and world language round out a student's schedule, preparing them for advanced courses in high school.
All of our students begin taking high school level courses in 7th grade with Algebra 1. 
ASD's curriculum is designed for students who plan on leaving after 8th grade, as well as those who plan on staying through graduation. The programs offer slightly different classes, but allows the flexibility for students who change their mind about their plans. For more information on the two programs, please click on the link below.
