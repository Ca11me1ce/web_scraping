ASD School Spirit Wear
ASD has been working with a great local company here in Nashua, Educational Outfitters, to develop a line of "ASD School Spirit Wear" for our kids, families, staff, and any other member of our community interested in purchasing some items. There are wonderful T-shirts, sweatshirts, jackets, hats, and even lab coats available for purchase. All purchases go directly through the website and can be delivered to your home or to the school (during the months that school is in operation.) This will be an ongoing opportunity for everyone with no ordering deadlines, and will be available year-round for all to enjoy.
Please note that this is not a fundraiser for ASD, as we want to keep costs as low as possible for all members of our community who would like to purchase these items simply to celebrate and represent our fabulous school. All purchases go directly through Educational Outfitters, and all questions regarding sizing, orders, etc. should be directed to them.
