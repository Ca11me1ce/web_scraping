Mission Statement
Byrneville Elementary School, Inc. is committed to the 
constant improvement of skills and knowledge
to provide an appropriate and safe environment
in which students can develop their academic,
emotional, physical, and social abilities to their fullest extent.
Please do not have students on campus before 7:15. 
Please do not drive around the car ahead of you in the drop off and pick up line.
All students are to enter through the front entrance to the main building.  
Check outs are to be done no later than 1:45. 
BREAKFAST INFORMATION
Students who come by car and are not eating breakfast do not need to be at school before 7:30.
Because of the number of students choosing to eat breakfast and a new computer system, we have made the choice to offer only one entrée for breakfast. We plan to send home what the entrée is for the month of September.
Our school grade for the 2016-2017 school year is a B.  We are rated as a "Highly Performing School".
