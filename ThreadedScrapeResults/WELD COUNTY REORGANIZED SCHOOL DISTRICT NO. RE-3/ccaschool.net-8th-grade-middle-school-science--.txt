Middle School Science
Hi there, my name is 
Sarah Johnson
!  Raised in the mid-west, I found myself heading to Colorado for my first teaching job the year of 2008.  Once we arrived, I fell in love with our small school in the country and its principles of education.  Since joining CCA, I have taught the middle science classes, directed an after school theatre program, coached volleyball for the district, and lead an out of state trip for our 8th grade students.  I find CCA to be a unique and perfect fit, and enjoy greatly instilling a love for learning and our world into our students.  Outside of school, I love playing instrumental music, reading, caring for my many pets, and volunteering at the Wild Animal Sanctuary.
