Middle School Math
6th and 8th Grade Math
Hi, my name is 
Joann Eisenman
.
This Baby Boomer was born in Peoria, Illinois, back many decades ago. I graduated from Greeley Central High School in 1967 and UNC in 1971.  After 34 years of teaching math at Weld Central Jr-Sr High School, I retired in 2005.  I started teaching part-time at CCA in the fall of 2007.  This December will mark my 45th year as a teacher.  I am REALLY excited about having a room this year and teaching 6th grade, 8th grade and Algebra 1. Besides teaching, I have kept the scorebook for the high school girl’s basketball team at Weld Central. I am a huge Rockies and Bronco fan!  Cinnamon, Belle and Kimmie are my three Cocker Spaniel dogs.  I have hundreds of ceramic and stuffed bears. Being around positive people is important to me, as well as my family.  I love when we get together and play games. I also enjoy reading. That’s all folks!!!!!!!!

Hello! I am 
Cassie Rosling
.
I was born and raised in Fort Morgan, CO for most of my life. I lived with my dad for a short time in Sterling. I come from a LARGE family that I love and adore! In fact, you may find it interesting that I have 13 brothers and sisters (all of which are half or step, but still loved the same)! I graduated from Woodlin High School, a class of only 12, in 2005. I went on to study Mathematics with the Secondary Teaching Emphasis at UNC in Greeley where I graduated with my Bachelors degree in 2010. While in college, I met my best friend who became my husband of almost 9 years now! We have four beautiful and wonderful kids, two of which currently attend CCA. Besides having a love for all things Math, I enjoy camping, jeeping, hiking, and spending time with family and friends. When I get some alone time I enjoy going away and scrap-booking memories of my life. I am so excited to start this new year and share my knowledge and enthusiasm for math!!
