WHO WE ARE
We are YOU!  We are parents, guardians, and teachers of students here at CCA committed to making this school the best place for our students to learn, grow, and become outstanding individuals. We meet the 2nd Friday of each month in the cafeteria 3:45pm. Childcare is not provided however, children are welcome to attend with you 
WHAT WE DO
We help with field trips, guest speakers, new technology, tools for teachers and other items that may not be otherwise attainable in the school budget.
HOW CAN I HELP
We typically have two main fundraisers per year, our Fall Festival in the Fall and the Spaghetti Dinner and Auction in the Spring.  Occasionally we have smaller fundraisers like our Pizza Night and ordering Spirit Gear. There are many ways you can help in these events, whether it be with set up, clean up, manning booths, or licking envelopes, your help is needed and appreciated!
You can also help CCA through our yearlong fundraisers.  Save and turn in your Box Tops! Our goal is $1000 this year!
Another way to help CCA is to add us as your charity when ordering through Amazon. Simply go to 
www.smile.amazon.com
 and select Cardinal Community Academy as your charity. Or download the smile.amazon app through the App store or Google Play.
