Physical Education
Hello,  my name is 
Katie Baker.
I am the mom of 2 girls and have been a wife for 10 plus years.  I attended the University of Northern Colorado for Kinesiology and played rugby there!  I currently hold a certificate from the National Academy of Sports Medicine as a Personal Trainer with an emphasis in Youth Sports.  I am also certified in Yoga and Crossfit.  I love camping, going to the lake, obstacle courses and races, and sharing simple changes to better health with others.
