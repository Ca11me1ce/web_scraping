1st Grade
Hello, my name is 
Melissa Baas
 and the 2017-2018 school year will be my first year teaching at CCA.  I am excited to be part of this amazing team and serve the students here.  I graduated from Metropolitan State University in 2005 and have been teaching for 12 years, all of which have been in the Weld Re-3J district.  Of those 12 years, 8 have been in first grade.  I believe that a child’s first grade year is filled with big goals, growth and a lot of amazing memories.  I look forward to establishing relationships with my new students and their families.
Outside of the classroom, I have many interests including photography, flower gardening, hiking, camping, four-wheeling, cycling, baking and being crafty.  I enjoy art galleries and theatre as well.  I am a native of Colorado and love living in a place where each sunrise and sunset is breathtaking.  At home, our family has many beloved four legged creatures including dogs, goats, horses and a donkey (who thinks he is a horse).
