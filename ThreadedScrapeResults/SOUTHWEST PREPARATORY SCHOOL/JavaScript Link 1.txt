Charter school partners with TAMUSA 
for early college high school program
Southwest Preparatory School is partnering with Texas A&MUniversity-San Antonio for a new early college high school program,school officials announced this week.
Starting this fall, students at the charter network’s Northwestcampus will be able to begin earning up to 60 credit hours toward afour-year college degree while directly attending classes on theuniversity’s campus. By the time the students graduate from high school,they could be about halfway toward earning a bachelor’s degree.
The tuition-free program will expose the high school studentsto college-level coursework and allow them to reduce the financialburden of college by graduating with a degree more quickly, said LauraRangel, Southwest Prep’s dean for the early college high school.
“This means that not only are they in high school, but they’re goingto college at the same time. And not only college, but a university,”she said.
