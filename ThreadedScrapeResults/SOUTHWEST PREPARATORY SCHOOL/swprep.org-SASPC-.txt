Supporting Students with Disabilities 
in Texas Schools
Welcome to the San Antonio 
Special Programs Co-op website. 
The SASPC 
provides quality special education programming and an array of related services to students with disabilities across South and Central Texas. Our dedicated staff supply exceptional, individualized support to our member school districts who have joined together to maximize their resources and provide a full continuum of special education services. In accordance with both state and federal law, the goal of special education is to socially and academically aid students with disabilities, while promoting independence and 
developing employability skills, as they move through the primary educational environment to post-secondary living. The SASPC, in conjunction with its member schools, is devoted to meeting these goals
