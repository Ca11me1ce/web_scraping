CGC – Charter Governance Council
The purpose of the Charter Governance Council is to govern the Nevada City School of the Arts in accordance with its school charter.  In turn, the school charter conforms to all provisions and requirements of California State charter school law.  NCSA utilizes the “Policy Governance” model to manage the school.
“Policy Governance®, an integrated board leadership paradigm created by Dr. John Carver, is a groundbreaking model of governance designed to empower boards of directors to fulfill their obligation of accountability for the organizations they govern. As a generic system, it is applicable to the governing body of any enterprise. The model enables the board to focus on the larger issues, to delegate with clarity, to control management’s job without meddling, to rigorously evaluate the accomplishment of the organization; to truly lead its organization.”
