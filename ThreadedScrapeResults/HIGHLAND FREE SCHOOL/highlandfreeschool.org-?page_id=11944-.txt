Curriculum
Our curriculum is aligned with the Arizona College and Career Ready Standards and includes individualized, skill-based assignments for the introduction and practice of basic skills. However, our emphasis is on integrated, thematic units that often use hands-on, innovative activities and projects designed to give students practice in applying the educational standards while strengthening their twentieth-century skills of creativity, collaboration, and communication.
