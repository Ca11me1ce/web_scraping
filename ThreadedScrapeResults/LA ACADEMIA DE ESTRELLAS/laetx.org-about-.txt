School Vision
We believe that a strong educational foundation is the key to success for all students.   In order for learning to occur, the school environment must be safe and nurturing.   All students do not learn in the same way or at the same rate, nor do they all start at the same place.  Therefore, instruction must be tailored to the needs of the students, and should provide opportunities that take the learner beyond the classroom walls.  Furthermore, students need to play an active role in their own learning, participating willingly in a risk-free environment, guided by nurturing, knowledgeable and effective teachers.
School Mission 
The mission of La Academia de Estrellas is to be a premier public charter school where students become life-long learners who actively participate in their own learning, remain engaged in the educaitonal process and show mater of the TEKS objectives at each grade level.

Community Involvement Through Service Projects
La Academia de Estrellas Charter School was established to provide innovative learning opportunities for students, by honoring diverse cultures, languages, backgrounds and academic abilities. The instructional foundation at La Academia de Estrellas is built upon three pillars:
1. Inquiry-based instruction, which engages students in open-ended, student-centered, hands-on activities, which support the acquisition and mastery of the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills.
2. Community based learning, where students, parents and teachers partner with community members to create connections between the classroom and real-world situations.
3. Differentiated, small group instruction to enable all students to learn according to their preferred learning style and at the appropriate level.
We currently offer prekindergarten (3 and 4 year olds) and grades K-8 at two locations. Grades K-8 are at our 100,000 s.f. facility at 4680 W. Kiest Blvd, at the southeast corner of Kiest and Walton Walker (Loop 12).
Pre-kindergarten is located at 1811 S. Hampton Road, which is about a half mile north of Hampton and Illinois and directly across the street from the Hampton DART station.
