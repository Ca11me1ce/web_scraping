Kindergarten - 2nd Grade
Kindergarten through 2nd grade is a time of rapid growth. Children strengthen basic skills and progress to higher-level thinking in literacy, math, science and social studies. As they become more aware of the world around them, they build empathy, compassion and understanding for others. They read to learn and understand the world, and write to express ideas and opinions. Preparing for algebra and beyond, they learn to apply more complex math skills.

We're More than Academics
We believe that strong hearts and minds impact the world in amazing ways. For this reason, we teach moral focus in every lesson. They are so meaningful to us that we celebrate them every month as a community with songs, skits and performances. We practice each virtue through:
Social contracts where we pledge to support and encourage each other.
Our CHAMPS classroom management system where children learn social responsibility.
Community outreach programs.
