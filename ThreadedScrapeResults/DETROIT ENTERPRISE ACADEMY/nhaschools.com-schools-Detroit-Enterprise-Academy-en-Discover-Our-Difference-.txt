Discover Our Difference
We believe children with a strong moral character and excellent college preparation will excel in any path they choose. We achieve this through our program built on the pillars of moral focus, academic excellence, personal responsibility and parental partnerships.
We Reach Higher
We focus on every child’s unique needs, abilities and interests, provide meaningful instruction and set high-standards to promote academic excellence.
We Build Character
Our Moral Focus curriculum makes virtues like respect, integrity, perseverance and courage part of every school day to build the strong moral character they need to be happy and successful.
We Expect More
We empower students to take personal responsibility for their academic success and character development to help them build the grit and skills they need to tackle any challenge with confidence.
We Work Together
We talk to you about your child’s progress, and offer a variety of volunteer opportunities to build essential parental partnerships.
More Information
We know there are a lot of factors in deciding where your child will go to school and we want to help. Use our live chat or leave your contact information and we'll be in touch.
