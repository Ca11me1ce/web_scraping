Become a Volunteer
Our highest priority is keeping our schools safe, so we’ve established a variety of security levels based on available volunteer opportunities. Please review the levels below to understand the security requirements for each opportunity and the necessary corresponding forms that must be completed before serving.
Level One
A school employee will always supervise the volunteer. Volunteers can work in classrooms and the office, but cannot handle money.
Requirements: Volunteer Authorization Release Form, State-Issued Photo ID
Level Two
A school employee or Level 3 volunteer provides limited supervision to the volunteer. Field trip chaperones, drivers, recess monitors are Level 2.
Requirements: Volunteer Authorization Release Form, State-Issued Photo ID, Background Check
Level Three
Volunteers can work with students with no direct supervision. They can chaperone overnight field trips and tutor students.
Requirements: Volunteer Authorization Form, State-Issued Photo ID, and Background Check
If you’re interested in serving as a volunteer, please let us know as soon possible. Paperwork and background checks can take time to process -- and we wouldn’t want you to miss out on your requested opportunity!
You may log in to the 
Parent Portal
 or contact the school to sign up as a volunteer.

Volunteer FAQs
