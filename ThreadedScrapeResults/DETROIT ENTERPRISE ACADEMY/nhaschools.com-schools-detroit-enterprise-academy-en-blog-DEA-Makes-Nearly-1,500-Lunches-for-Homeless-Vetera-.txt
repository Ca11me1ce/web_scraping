				In honor of Veteran’s Day, students and staff of Detroit Enterprise Academy (DEA) made more than 1,500 Lunches of Love after school on Nov. 8 to be distributed to homeless veterans on Friday, Nov. 10.
The brown bag lunches included a sandwich, drink, snack, and a handwritten note of encouragement from students.
“This was an amazing event where our students got to put their moral focus virtues into practice,” said Chanavia Patterson, DEA principal. “This month our moral focus is gratitude. This was one way our students could put into action their gratitude for veterans and what they have done for our country.”
The community service project was the fourth year the school partnered with Brown Bag Lunches of Love (IBBLoL), who donated many of the food items for the lunches.
The founder of IBBLoL, Diane Renee Souillere, distributed the lunches to veterans at the Detroit Rescue Mission on Veteran’s Day.​
