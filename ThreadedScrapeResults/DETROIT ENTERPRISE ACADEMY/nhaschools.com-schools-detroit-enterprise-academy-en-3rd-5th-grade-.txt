3rd - 5th Grade
Teachers build on basic skills students learned in earlier grades to help students apply higher-level thinking to all subjects. Improved reading comprehension opens doors to a deeper understanding of ideas, topics and events. Socially, children begin to internalize values like respect and cooperation, and learn more personal responsibility. Most importantly, students build the skills they need to succeed in middle school.

English Language Arts
Learning to read becomes reading to learn. As fluency and comprehension improve, students learn to make inferences and draw conclusions. Children write more complex stories, essays and poetry. Improving their speaking skills, children present reports and narratives in small group and classroom settings. Our teachers use tools like Reading Street © to support instruction in line with state standards.
						Math 
						Curriculum					
Math
Children strengthen multiplication, division and fraction skills. They learn place value for large numbers, and decimals. Teachers expand geometry skills through the study of more complex two and three- dimensional states. Preparing for algebra, students graph data and evaluate expressions. As they progress, students learn to select the right strategy to solve real-world math problems. 
						Science 
						Curriculum					
Science
Children study more complex human and animal systems. In Earth science, children study forces that act on the Earth, like erosion, rock formation and the hydrosphere. In Physics, they build an understanding of matter and energy. They explore the properties of waves, like sound, light and color. Children begin to connect concepts to real-life applications in technology, mechanics and engineering.
						Social Studies

We're More than Academics
We believe that strong hearts and minds impact the world in amazing ways. For this reason, we teach moral focus in every lesson. They are so meaningful to us that we celebrate them every month as a community with songs, skits and performances. We practice each virtue through:
Social contracts where we pledge to support and encourage each other.
Our CHAMPS classroom management system where children learn social responsibility.
Community outreach programs.
