WELLNESS POLICY
Arkansas Arts Academy Wellness Policy
Arkansas Arts Academy is always evolving in a positive direction when it comes to the wellness aspects of education. The administration team is conscientious of the importance of the role of wellness in regard to academic success as well as success in the arts. The administrative team members work hard to be role models, demonstrating the importance of proper nutritional habits and exercise. It is a topic that is discussed and evaluated throughout the year. 
Nutrition Education
Arkansas Arts Academy provides an all-inclusive learning environment for developing lifelong wellness behaviors. We promote a comprehensive approach to positive nutrition practices in kindergarten through twelfth grade. 
Nutrition Promotion
Arkansas Arts Academy develops and promotes nutritional guidance and education by using scientific research to guide the nutritional needs of our students. 
Physical Activity
Arkansas Arts Academy believes in the importance of the PE 4 Life program in the K-8 curriculums. All K-8 students have PE every day. The K-8 Campus includes a half-mile trail for mountain biking and running. Many students participate in the Girls on the Run program. Arkansas Arts Academy has NICA (National Interscholastic Cycling Association) mountain bike programing in the middle and high school program as well as a cross country competitive program.
School Lunch Program
All foods available on school grounds during the school day meet or exceed state nutrition standards. Arkansas Arts Academy emphasizes food items that are nutrient dense per calorie. The district ensures high quality, nutritious meals. Arkansas Arts Academy is sensitive to variety, appeal, taste, safety, and packaging. Both campuses offer breakfast and lunch.
Arkansas Arts Academy consults parents, invites them to join their students for lunch, and respects their input and ideas. Arkansas Arts Academy reaches out to community corporations such as the local Tyson Foods company for ideas on fresh ways to fix and prepare nutritious and appetizing meals. The CEO and the administration team evaluate the school programs on a consistent basis.
