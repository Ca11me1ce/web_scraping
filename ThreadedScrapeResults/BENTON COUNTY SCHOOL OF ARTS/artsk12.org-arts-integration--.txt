Arts Integration
Arts Integration is an approach to teaching in which students construct and demonstrate understanding through an art form. Students engage in a creative process which connects an art form and another subject area and meets evolving objectives in both. *
Arkansas Arts Academy’s arts integration program is deeply rooted in our partnership with Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art. Our teachers incorporate the fine art collection into the classroom by integrating the visual arts or art history as a discipline into the lessons of their specific academic subject through “Collections Connections,” a curriculum developed by museum educators and AAA’s arts integration director.
