Orchestra
The Arkansas Arts Academy orchestra program provides students with unique opportunities to play music in many different styles and genres.
The AAA orchestra regularly partners with other arts disciplines to present collaborative concerts. Whether they are playing chamber music, accompanying live dance performances, or playing as a string section within the Rockhoppers band, orchestra students are given many opportunities to expand their skills and gain valuable performance experience.
A symphony must be like the world. It must contain everything.
