K-5 Music
General Music at Arkansas Arts Academy is a thorough and enjoyable exploration of music making and learning through singing and the use of musical instruments. Students are introduced to music notation, pitch recognition, note values, rhythms, melody, and all elements of music making.
General music students in Grades 3-5 participate annually in LinkUp! performances on the high school campus of Arkansas Arts Academy with the Arkansas Philharmonic Orchestra. Visiting performing artists frequently visit both the high school and elementary/middle school campuses performing and giving master classes. These extracurricular experiences in performing are unique to our school.
Students advance from General Music into several and varied specific music interest classes where each student can fulfill his/her own love of music making.
