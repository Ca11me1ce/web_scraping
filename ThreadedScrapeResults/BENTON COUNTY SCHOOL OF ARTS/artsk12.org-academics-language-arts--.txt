Language Arts
In our language arts classes, we seek to develop an understanding and appreciation of modern and classical works of literature and rhetoric.
Emphasis is placed on various types of writing including expository, argumentative, and narrative as we work to ensure that our students gain the skills needed for success in college composition courses, as well as the technical writing skills needed in careers. Accordingly, we also establish vital research skills needed as the basis for all areas of study.
In order to contribute to our school’s goal of achievement through the arts, each teacher includes multiple arts integration projects and arts enhancement lessons throughout the year to strengthen the understanding of our coursework by our diverse student body.
