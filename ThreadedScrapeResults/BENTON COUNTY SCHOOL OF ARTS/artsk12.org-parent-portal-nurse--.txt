Nurse’s Office Information
Here is some information for parents/guardians:
1. New Guidelines for Sending a Student to the Nurse
These are the only reasons a student will be sent to the nurse:
a. For daily prescription medication.
b. If they need to be sent home for fever, vomiting, diarrhea, etc.
c. Emergencies.
2. A Clear Water Bottle for School
Please send a clear water bottle to school with your child. While at school, students need to drink two to four bottles of water daily to stay adequately hydrated. Without a water bottle, it is difficult for students to get enough water from the water fountain, and dehydration results.
Common symptoms of dehydration include
headache
dizziness
light-headedness
tiredness
irritability
3. Students in Kindergarten, First, and Second Grades
Please keep a change of clean clothes in your child’s backpack in case of “accidents.”
