Choral Music
There are many opportunities in vocal music at Arkansas Arts Academy. Our choir program has grown tremendously over the years with all choirs earning many regional and state honors. We have five different choirs, and students can be part of one or many depending on their interests and skill level.
Concert Choir (Voci Ispirata), Men’s Barbershop (the Beau Ties), and Women’s Barbershop are all non-audition choirs that students can join. We have two audition-only choirs: Advanced Women’s (Bella Canta) and Show Choir (SHOC).
Students in all choirs compete at both regional and state level and participate in community events such as “Holiday on the Bricks” in downtown Rogers, “Christmas at the Crescent Hotel” in Eureka Springs, and the Crohns and Colitis walk and the Christmas Gala at Peel Mansion, to name a few. We work very closely with our community’s barbershop choruses—Pride of the Ozarks (men) and Arkapella Show Chorus (women)—as we host the annual “Youth in Harmony” barbershop event at Arkansas Arts Academy every fall, which includes high schools from all over Northwest Arkansas.
Students in the choir program are encouraged to attend camps such as Show Choir Camps of America in Tiffin, Ohio, and Harmony University in Nashville. Come join the fun!
The arts are not simply skills: their concern is the intellectual, ethical, and spiritual maturity of human life. And in a time when religious and political institutions are so busy engraving images of marketable gods and candidates that they lose their vision of human dignity, the arts have become the custodians of those values which most worthily define humanity, which most sensitively define Divinity.
