Theatre
Arkansas Arts Academy’s department of theatre strives to craft performers who have a deep understanding of various acting methods and techniques while simultaneously developing respect of self, others, and surroundings. Within their appropriately leveled classes, students are encouraged to engage their skills of observation, cooperation, and reflection. They learn to work in an ensemble to build a unit of art that connects performers and audience alike.
Technical theatre classes involve students in the hands-on construction of sets while teaching skills applicable to theatre, communication, and problem-solving.
For students who have fulfilled prerequisites, the department offers an acting-intensive, audition-only company.
Acting is an everlasting search for truth.
