Campus Safety
            Released                February 21st, 2018  |                    
IMPORTANT MESSAGE TO ALL PARENTS:
Incident at our Empowerment Campus
Today, February 21st, we learned about a threatening post on social media at our Empowerment campus. We contacted the Houston Police Department, which quickly investigated the situation together with us. The students were never in any danger, and we took all necessary measures to ensure the safety and security of our students. All parents from the campus have been contacted and made aware of the situation. We are working
local authorities to increase law enforcement presence at and around our campuses. As a district, we are also implementing additional safety measures to keep our campuses safe. 
Communication is a key component in safety measures. Please feel free to communicate with us, and encourage your child/children to share their thoughts and feelings with you and with us.
We want to reassure all parents our commitment to providing a safe and positive learning environment for our students and staff. All Southwest campuses will continue to operate under regular hours tomorrow, Thursday, February 22, 2018.
Thank you,
Southwest Schools Administration
