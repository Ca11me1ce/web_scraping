Project Lead The Way
Thanks to a generous grant from 
Chevron
, Southwest Schools is expanding the 
Project Lead The Way (PLTW)
 program across the District.   The grant will focus on the implementation of three programs:  LAUNCH for elementary; GATEWAY for middle school;  ENGINEERING for high school.
PLTW is a nonprofit organization that provides a transformative learning experience for K-12 students and teachers across the U.S.  Among other significant findings, independent research studies reveal that PLTW students outperform their peers in school, are better prepared for post-secondary studies, and are more likely to consider careers as scientists, technology experts, engineers, mathematicians, healthcare providers, and researchers compared to their non-PLTW peers.

LAUNCH
INTRODUCING YOUNG MINDS TO THE WONDERS OF STEM
Engaging students at a young age builds confidence, grows interest, and puts them on course for strong accomplishments in middle school, high school, and beyond.
Through PLTW Launch, our program for kindergarten through fifth grade, students become problem solvers. Students use structured approaches, like the engineering design process, and employ critical thinking. They apply STEM knowledge, skills, and habits of mind, learning that it is OK to take risks and make mistakes. As teachers and students learn and discover together, education becomes far more engaging. We designed PLTW Launch to offer maximum flexibility and work in a variety of settings and scenarios, which means we have an implementation model that will work for your school or organization.
GATEWAY
ENGAGING STUDENTS’ NATURAL CURIOSITY AND IMAGINATION
Middle school is the perfect time for students to explore and learn that there is more than one way to reach a solution. PLTW Gateway provides engineering, biomedical, and computer science curriculum for middle school students that challenges, inspires, and offers schools variety and flexibility. Students get rigorous and relevant experiences through activity-, project-, and problem-based learning. They use industry-leading technology to solve problems while gaining skills in communication, collaboration, critical-thinking, and creativity.
ENGINEERING
DESIGN FOR A SUCCESSFUL FUTURE AWAITS
PLTW Engineering is more than just another high school engineering program. It is about applying engineering, science, math, and technology to solve complex, open-ended problems in a real-world context. Students focus on the process of defining and solving a problem, not on getting the “right” answer. They learn how to apply STEM knowledge, skills, and habits of mind to make the world a better place through innovation.
PLTW students have said that PLTW Engineering influenced their post-secondary decisions and helped shape their future. Even for students who do not plan to pursue engineering after high school, the PLTW Engineering program provides opportunities to develop highly transferable skills in collaboration, communication, and critical thinking, which are relevant for any coursework or career.
STEM education is key to keeping the U.S. competitive. Project Lead The Way offers students and educators world-class curricula and teacher training to help kids obtain the in-demand, transferable skills they need to excel. Chevron is proud to partner with Project Lead The Way to help provide access to engineering curriculum to 100,000 students across the U.S.
