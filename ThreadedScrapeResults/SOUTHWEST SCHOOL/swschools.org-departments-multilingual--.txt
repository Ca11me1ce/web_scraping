FAQ
Safety/Security
At Southwest Schools we take safety and security of our students, staff and visitors very seriously. As a district we are committed to creating safe, secure and caring learning environments where all students, staff and visitors work together to promote safety and academic excellence. This emphasis has resulted in a safe schools plan that includes a purposeful connection between physical safety/security and the “psychological safety” of students. Physical safety includes measures such as visitor check-in and identification badges, video surveillance, preparedness planning, and practice drills to prepare for a variety of potential incidents. District and school crisis plans are aligned with the recommendations of state Homeland Security, local emergency responders, and public safety officials. Psychological safety provides for the social-emotional well-being of students and works to create positive school climates through measures such as asset development, bullying prevention, positive behavior support, and early identification and intervention for at-risk students.
Southwest School District has comprehensive emergency procedure plans in place. The Southwest Schools District works closely with each campus and local public safety agencies on contingency planning and ensuring the proper response of necessary emergency services. This partnership stands ready to address any situation that may arise.
If you have questions, comments and/or concerns in regards to safery and security at any Southwest Schools Campus, please contact Paul Kandola @ 713-784-635 X26 or email
