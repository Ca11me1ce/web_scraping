Our History
The earliest evidence of children receiving formal education in what is now Sanger Unified School occurred in 1860.  Scottsburg, one of the first school districts organized in Fresno County, served a community on the Kings River.  In the following one hundred fifty plus years, many new schools were organized while others were abandoned or consolidated.
