  Arts For Any Given Child
Action Plan 2016-2017 School Year
During the 2015-2016 school year, Sanger Unified teamed up with The Kennedy Center and the Fresno County Office of Education to implement the "Any Given Child" program. The Sanger Community Arts Team was formed to study current instruction in visual and performing arts, identify areas of need, and create an action plan to address those needs over the next five years.

Vision
It is the vision of the Sanger Community Arts Team that all TK-8 students have access and opportunities to participate, exhibit, perform and celebrate dance, music, theatre and visual arts through sequential, standards-based curriculum and instruction that inspire creativity throughout the community.
Mission
Teaching artists, staff members, arts organizations and the community will work together to enrich the arts experience for students and engage as audience members, mentors and supporters for the arts in schools.
