  SARC
School Accountability Report Cards 2016-17
Education Code Section 3526 requires that school districts annually develop a School Accountability Report Card (SARC) for each school in the district.  These report cards provide a variety of data to allow the public to evaluate and compare schools in terms of student achievement, environment, resources and demographics.  The 2014-15 School Accountability Report Cards (English and Spanish), which were published during the 2015-16 school year, and are the most current available, are posted below.
