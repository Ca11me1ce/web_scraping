SUSD Financial Information
As you all know, the State's economy continues to be at an all-time low.The cuts to education are at an all-time high, making the education environment very unsettling. Never in the history of Sanger Unified have we experienced the reductions we are experiencing today.
With the uncertain future we are facing I believe it will take all of us working together to overcome these challenges. It is my belief that our strength comes from every employee, student and community member whose commitment is to the success of our students.
In an effort to provide information pertinent to our budget and the steps we are taking to succeed during these times, we have created this webpage. In it you will find various areas that address multiple budget elements. It is my hope to provide answers to many of the questions that may arise during this difficult time.
Although we find ourselves exasperated in the position the State has placed us, I would like to extend my heartfelt appreciation to every employee in Sanger Unified School District for continuing to provide the level of service we have become renowned for. We must not lose hope. This team has reached unprecedented levels. Our achievements are examples of the tenacity and resiliency we are capable of.
