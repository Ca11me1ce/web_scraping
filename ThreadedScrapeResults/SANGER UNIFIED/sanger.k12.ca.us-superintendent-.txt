Superintendent's Message
Dream Big, Work Hard, and Believe!
“Every Child, Every Day, Whatever It Takes!” has been the motto of Sanger Unified for over 10 years and I am proud and honored to continue our journey toward improvement.
It is because of the hard work of our employees and students that Sanger continues to be a great place to raise a family and educate children. Our goal is to promote early childhood literacy and to prepare students to be college and career-ready with options and opportunity. In Sanger, we believe in the following core principles:
Hope is not a strategy
Don't blame the kids
It's about learning
Believe all students can and must learn 
Our Board of Trustees is committed to high quality instruction and working alongside District leadership to achieve our District goals. Our goals are focused on increasing student achievement, closing the achievement gap, early childhood Pre-Kindergarten-3rd grade literacy, and developing college and career pathways in a 21st century learning environment. We believe in building a collaborative culture focused on results not intentions, providing focused professional development supporting the transition to Common Core Standards, and strengthening our Multi-Tier Systems of Support (MTSS) of Academics, Response to Intervention (RTI), and Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS). Most importantly, we are building the capacity of all stakeholders, parents and community to serve as partners in the learning journey and investing bond revenues to support the facilities master plan, enrollment growth, and ensure safe learning environments.
We believe the future of our city, state and country are in our classrooms. As educators, it is our duty to produce students who have educational opportunities and options for their future.
Our work in Sanger is about three foundational concepts that guide our work as we push ourselves to meet the needs of all students: having the right information, building our relationships, and continuing to refocus on our identity. These are the pillars we use to build collaborative educational processes, high expectations and increased rigor for all students.
We are fortunate to live and work in a community that values our schools and the education of its young people. Together we will continue to improve student achievement, one child at a time. Together we will prepare college and career-ready graduates who are ready to make a positive contribution to our city, communities, state, and country.
As we work together we continue to Dream Big, Work Hard and Believe; Every Child, Every Day, Whatever It Takes!
