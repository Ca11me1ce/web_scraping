Science Fair Grant Opportunity:  Are you interested in doing a science fair project next year? Do you have an innovative idea that you’d like to test out? 
Thanks to the "Arepalli-Karumuri Family Grant" funds are available through the Clear Creek Education Foundation to help enhance CCISD Science Fair projects for the next school year. This funding is in honor of some outstanding individuals and CCISD educators who have had a lasting impact on many CCISD students.
Secondary science fair students may apply for up to $500 for their 2018-2019 science fair project under the guidance and sponsorship of a teacher.  
Science Fair Innovative Grants will be awarded for one-time, new or enhancements to science fair projects to be implemented within the 2018-2019 school year.
A student may only submit one grant application.
Projects are reviewed and evaluated on an individual basis.
These grants are intended to fund projects that are supported by CCEF's mission and goals.
Students with questions or who are interested in participating in science fair next year can come talk to Mrs. Bufford in room S.252.  The deadline to apply for this grant is March 31, 2018 so act quickly!!

Advisory:
 Every day students will report to Advisory class by 8:00 AM.  Advisory is a critical class for students each day as we disseminate crucial information and touch base with every student.  Seniors meet in the BQR and all other students will meet in the classroom stated on their schedules.  Students will see their names and Advisory locations posted in the main hallways on the first day of school.
Service Learning:
 The absolute final due date for all Service Learning hours to be submitted is:
March 29
 – All Service Learning Hours (at least 20 hours) must be turned in by this date.
As service learning is a key aspect of our mission at Clear Horizons, students who do not meet the 20 hour requirement will meet with Clear Horizons administration to explain the deficit.  Students who refuse to meet the requirement will be returned to their zoned campus.
Dress Code:
  Clear Horizons follows the CCISD dress code.  The student dress code can be found on our website under the “For Parents” tab or the “For Students” tab.

Late Bus:  Clear Horizons provides a late bus that runs every Tuesday and Thursday at 4:45 PM.  The late bus will be in front of our school by 4:45 p.m. each Tuesday and Thursday and typically departs within 10 minutes. The late bus will drop off in two locations: The East side of 45 at Clear Creek High School and on the West side of 45 at Brookside Intermediate. Students who are planning on riding the late bus must request a pass from the office. The request must be made for official business only (ie tutorials, a rehearsal, detention, etc.). A bus pass must be picked up before 1:00 p.m. on the day you want to ride (Tuesday or Thursday). No bus passes will be issued after lunch.  
If you do not have a pass you will not be allowed to ride the bus.  If no one has picked up a late bus pass, the bus will be cancelled. Students, make sure that your parent/guardian knows that you are staying late and catching the late bus. The front office closes at 3:30p.m.  When signing up for pass students must include the following:
1) Purpose – Why are you staying late?
2) Location from 3:30 – 5:00 – Where will you be?
3) Parent Permission – Did you let your parent know you were staying late?
The reason we must have this information is so that we can find you in case of an emergency.
Driving your own vehicle to school?  All students who drive and park on campus must register with SJC for a parking permit.  Beginning this school year, all students who drive to school must also register their vehicles with the Clear Horizons office.  Please stop by the office to get a copy of the Clear Horizons Parking Regulations and a Clear Horizons Vehicle Registration Form.
