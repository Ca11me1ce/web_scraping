Late Bus:  Clear Horizons provides a late bus that runs every Tuesday and Thursday at 4:45 PM.  The late bus will be in front of our school by 4:45 p.m. each Tuesday and Thursday and typically departs within 10 minutes. The late bus will drop off in two locations: The East side of 45 at Clear Creek High School and on the West side of 45 at Brookside Intermediate. Students who are planning on riding the late bus must request a pass from the office. The request must be made for official business only (ie tutorials, a rehearsal, detention, etc.). A bus pass must be picked up before 1:00 p.m. on the day you want to ride (Tuesday or Thursday). No bus passes will be issued after lunch.  
If you do not have a pass you will not be allowed to ride the bus.  If no one has picked up a late bus pass, the bus will be cancelled. Students, make sure that your parent/guardian knows that you are staying late and catching the late bus. The front office closes at 3:30p.m.  When signing up for pass students must include the following:
1) Purpose – Why are you staying late?
2) Location from 3:30 – 5:00 – Where will you be?
