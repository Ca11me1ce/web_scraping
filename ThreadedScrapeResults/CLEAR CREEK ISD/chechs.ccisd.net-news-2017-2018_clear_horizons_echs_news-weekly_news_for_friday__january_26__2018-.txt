Textbooks:  All college textbooks in inventory have been distributed to students.  Any textbooks not yet provided are on order with the SJC Bookstore and students will be notified of their availability via Naviance; therefore, all students should ensure they have added a working email address to their Naviance account.  Additionally, any students whose professors are not using the textbook are encouraged to return their book(s) to the Bookroom as soon as possible as lost or damaged textbooks can be costly.
Copy Room Paper:  Thank you to the Booster Club for supplying us with a year’s worth of paper last spring!!  Unfortunately what that means is our paper supply is almost depleted and we will be going back to our system of students supplying their own paper.
***Beginning Monday, February 5, students will have to supply their own paper to the printer room. Paper may be purchased for $.01 per sheet (a penny per page) at the front desk in the main office.***
Booster Club:  There is still time to join the Booster Club!!  Just go to 
http://chechs.ccisd.net/booster_club/booster_club
 and select the membership form.  Complete and return the form to the office with the membership dues and you are in!  Students ages 16 and older are also able to join the Booster Club!  Each family membership and each individual student membership gives the student a chance at the Booster Club Scholarship at the end of his or her senior year!!
Booster Club Officers:  We thank you all for your support and welcome our new officers!
President: Ms. Shinder
Vice President: Mr. Delacruz
Treasurer: Ms. Smith
We are still in need of a secretary.  Please let us know if you are interested in helping with this important position on the executive committee.
8th Grade Student/Parent Information Nights:  It’s that time of year!  The time when we pack up our information and tour the district telling 8th grade students and their families about our amazing school!  Clear Horizons will be conducting six 8th Grade Student/Parent Information Nights on the following dates:
Tuesday, January 30:      Clear Creek Intermediate School 
Thursday, February 1:    Clear Lake Intermediate School (New Date)
Tuesday, February 6:      Bayside Intermediate School 
Tuesday, February 13:    Clear Horizons ECHS (SJC South Bldg 11)
Late Arrival Day: Wednesday, February 7, is a CCISD High School Late Arrival Day.  There will be no morning neighborhood buses available due to CCISD High School Late Arrival. Clear Horizons buses will still run from the 5 zoned high schools (
a shuttle does not run from Clear View High School on Late Arrival Days).  Clear Horizons does not participate in Late Arrival Days, therefore all Clear Horizons students are required to attend all classes on that day.
Clear Horizons Shirts:  We still have Clear Horizons Coyote shirts available for purchase in the front office.  Short sleeve and women’s V-neck shirts are $15, long sleeve shirts are $20.  Buy yours today while supplies last!
Yearbooks:  Yearbooks are on sale now!  Order online at balfour.com or pay cash/check PAYABLE to CHECHS to Mrs. Hampton in 9.268.  Cost is $35 from January 1 – April 30.  From May 1st until books sell out, books cost $40.  Order yours today!
Advisory:
 Every day students will report to Advisory class by 8:00 AM.  Advisory is a critical class for students each day as we disseminate crucial information and touch base with every student.  Seniors meet in the BQR and all other students will meet in the classroom stated on their schedules.  Students will see their names and Advisory locations posted in the main hallways on the first day of school.
Service Learning:
 The absolute final due date for all Service Learning hours to be submitted is:
March 29
 – All Service Learning Hours (at least 20 hours) must be turned in by this date.
As service learning is a key aspect of our mission at Clear Horizons, students who do not meet the 20 hour requirement will meet with Clear Horizons administration to explain the deficit.  Students who refuse to meet the requirement will be returned to their zoned campus.
Dress Code:
  Clear Horizons follows the CCISD dress code.  The student dress code can be found on our website under the “For Parents” tab or the “For Students” tab.

Late Bus:  Clear Horizons provides a late bus that runs every Tuesday and Thursday at 4:45 PM.  The late bus will be in front of our school by 4:45 p.m. each Tuesday and Thursday and typically departs within 10 minutes. The late bus will drop off in two locations: The East side of 45 at Clear Creek High School and on the West side of 45 at Brookside Intermediate. Students who are planning on riding the late bus must request a pass from the office. The request must be made for official business only (ie tutorials, a rehearsal, detention, etc.). A bus pass must be picked up before 1:00 p.m. on the day you want to ride (Tuesday or Thursday). No bus passes will be issued after lunch.  
If you do not have a pass you will not be allowed to ride the bus.  If no one has picked up a late bus pass, the bus will be cancelled. Students, make sure that your parent/guardian knows that you are staying late and catching the late bus. The front office closes at 3:30p.m.  When signing up for pass students must include the following:
1) Purpose – Why are you staying late?
2) Location from 3:30 – 5:00 – Where will you be?
3) Parent Permission – Did you let your parent know you were staying late?
The reason we must have this information is so that we can find you in case of an emergency.
Driving your own vehicle to school?  All students who drive and park on campus must register with SJC for a parking permit.  Beginning this school year, all students who drive to school must also register their vehicles with the Clear Horizons office.  Please stop by the office to get a copy of the Clear Horizons Parking Regulations and a Clear Horizons Vehicle Registration Form.
