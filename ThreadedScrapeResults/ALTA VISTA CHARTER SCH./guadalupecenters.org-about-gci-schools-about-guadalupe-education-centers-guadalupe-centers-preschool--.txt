Guadalupe Centers Early Childhood Center
The Guadalupe Centers Early Childhood Center, formerly known as “Plaza de Ninos” first opened its doors in 1985. We are accredited through the National Association for the Education of Young Children. We are a Head Start program and teach Creative Curriculum along with Conscious Discipline. Creative Curriculum focuses on building a child’s confidence, creativity and critical thinking skills and Conscious Discipline works on building children’s social and emotional needs, both tools that are beneficial in the student’s development.
Our teachers receive training and professional development throughout the year as well as on site coaching to support them in the classrooms. Our preschool is housed in the Francis Institute located at MCC Penn Valley.
