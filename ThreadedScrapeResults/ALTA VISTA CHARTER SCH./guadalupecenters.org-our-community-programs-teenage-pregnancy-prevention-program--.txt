Teenage Pregnancy Prevention Program
Guadalupe Centers Programs
Teenage Pregnancy Prevention Program
In 1982 as a response to a pronounced increase of teenage pregnancies in the community, the Guadalupe Centers launched the Teen Pregnancy Program. Births to adolescent mothers correlate highly with low birth-weight infants, birth complications, dropping out of high school, and poverty. As a socially and medically under-served population, Latino adolescents are at an even greater risk to the adverse consequences of teen pregnancy.
The program, designed to provide culturally sensitive and comprehensive care, serves pregnant or parenting teenage girls and their families. Through case management, staff tailor care to the client’s individual situation. Services are fully bilingual (Spanish/English) and include prenatal and parenting education classes, transportation to medical and ancillary appointments, and follow-up for two years after the baby’s birth.
Services offered:
Individual case management
Prenatal education
Parenting Education
Family Planning
Housing Assistance
Medicaid and Food Stamp application assistance
Car seat training & education

Transportation to medical and ancillary appointments
Information & referral
