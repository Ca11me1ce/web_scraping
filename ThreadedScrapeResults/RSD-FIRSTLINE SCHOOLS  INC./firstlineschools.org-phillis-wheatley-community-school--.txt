Adventures
ESYNOLA

Athletics
Wheatley is a member of the New Orleans Charter School Athletic Association. Wheatley scholars in grades 5 through 8 can compete in flag football, baseball, basketball, volleyball, and softball.
Enrichment
Wheatley offers scholars afterschool clubs including art, ballet, dance, debate, gardening and culinary arts classes, Girl Scouts, yoga, running clubs and track, robotics and mentoring through Each One Save One.
Experiences
Lower School scholars take fruit-picking trips, visit an animal farm, and tour local museums. Scholars in grades 4 through 7 participate in end-of-the-year outdoor education field trips, ranging from canoing and hiking to wilderness skills and overnight camping. Our 8th grade scholars’ end-of-the-year experience focuses on high-school skills and college readiness. Eighth graders visit out-of-state colleges and participate in a five-week career prep program.
