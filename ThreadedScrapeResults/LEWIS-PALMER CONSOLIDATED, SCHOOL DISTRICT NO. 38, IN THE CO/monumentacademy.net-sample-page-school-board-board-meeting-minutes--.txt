Board Meetings
Meetings Schedule
The next Board Meeting is scheduled for Thursday April 12th at 6:00pm in the school library.
The Monument Academy Board of Directors holds monthly board meetings at the school. MA Board Meeting agendas are posted in our main entrance window at 1150 Village Ridge Pt., Monument, CO.
Board Meeting Minutes
Minutes of Board meetings are posted after formal approval by the Board usually within 48 hours of that approval.  Minutes of one month’s meeting are reviewed and approved at their next scheduled meeting.  This may mean minutes of a Board meeting in one month will be approved the following month.  To view previously approved minutes click on one of the dates below for the approved minutes of that meeting.
Board Meeting Highlights
Since there can be as much as a 30-day delay in the posting of approved minutes, a summary of a meeting’s business items, discussions, public comments and actions taken by the Board are posted as highlights usually within 3 business days after the meeting.  To view the highlights of the last Board meeting click:
