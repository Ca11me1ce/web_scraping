Announcement
Do you have school spirit? The 2018-2019 school year will usher in a new era of school spirit with the launching of our Jr. Lynx Poms team for our younger student-athletes! Our main focus for the year will be on character traits, team building skills and level one stunts. We expect to have a fun and safe environment for our student-athletes to learn and grow! We’ll occasionally get to work with the older girls on the CCAL Cheer team, and we’ll get to perform at many of the CCAL Basketball B-Team games! If you’re ready for a great opportunity to show your school spirit and meet some amazing new people along the way then join our Jr. Lynx Poms team!
Clinics and tryouts will begin in August and September, the season will run from October through February. We’ll let you know more specifics as the new school year approaches. Go Lynx!
