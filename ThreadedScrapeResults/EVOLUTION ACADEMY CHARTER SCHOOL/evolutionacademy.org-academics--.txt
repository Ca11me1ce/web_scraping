Academics
Evolution Academy has an academic offering that is unmatched by other public, charter or private schools. With a low student­-teacher ratio of 18:1, the progressive charter school is able to offer one­on­one attention with a mix of traditional and accelerated computer­based instruction, which is what many students need to advance to the next level. Students are able to earn up to ½ credit hours every nine weeks, which allows them to catch up or graduate early.
The Richardson campus boasts more than 50,000 square feet and includes a science lab, fitness center and wellness program, piano lab, culinary arts program, full-­service cafeteria and a state­of­the­art music studio where students learn to write and produce music. The school also offers multiple career and technical education courses that prepare students for certificates in professional fields such as medical billing and coding and video game design.
The school serves breakfast and lunch to all students and also offers DART bus passes so students can attend the Richardson campus from all over the Dallas/Ft. Worth Metroplex.
Evolution Academy offers three graduation plans which are approved by the state of Texas:
Minimum Graduation Plan (22 credits)
Recommended High School Program (24 credits)
Distinguished Achievement Program (26 credits)
Evolution Academy has graduated nearly 2000 students since inception. Evolution Academy graduates have gone on to graduate from some of the top colleges and universities in the country, enlist in military service or embark on productive careers in the workforce.
