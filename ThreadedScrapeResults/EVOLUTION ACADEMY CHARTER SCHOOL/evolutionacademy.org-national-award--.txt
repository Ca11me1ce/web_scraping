Founder Cynthia Trigg nominated for national award
RICHARDSON – Epitome Magazine recently nominated Cynthia Trigg, founder and chief executive officer of Evolution Academy Charter School, for the Community Uplift of the Year Award for her life-changing work with high-risk students in Texas. Trigg and the other nominees will be recognized at the Epitome Awards gala on Aug. 17 in Dallas.
Trigg was nominated for her innovation in education and her unique program that gives at-risk high school students at second chance. With more than twenty years of experience in education, Trigg founded Evolution Academy Charter School in 2002 with a vision to enable its students to achieve academic, social and career success. With a low student-teacher ratio of 18:1, the progressive charter school is able to offer one-on-one attention with a mix of traditional and computer-based instruction, which is what many students need to advance to the next level.
With Trigg at the helm, Evolution Academy has graduated nearly 2,000 students and expanded four times. The Richardson campus boasts more than 50,000 square feet and includes a science lab, fitness center and wellness program, piano lab, culinary arts program, full-service cafeteria and a state-of-the-art music studio where students learn to write and produce music. The school also offers multiple career and technical education courses that prepare students for certificates in professional fields such as medical billing and coding and video game design.
With an eleven-year track record of student success, Trigg recently received approval from Texas Education Agency to expand. This August, Evolution Academy Charter School will be opening campuses in Houston, Beaumont and Port Arthur.
Evolution Academy is a public charter high school, serving students grades 9-12. The school offers two convenient sessions, Monday – Friday from 7:45 a.m. to 11:45 a.m. and 12:20 p.m. to 4:20 p.m. Evolution Academy is currently accepting applications for enrollment for the 2013-2014 school year at all of its campuses. Classes begin on Aug. 19.
