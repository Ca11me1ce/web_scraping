Curriculum
At East Prep, our philosophy and approach to education is to provide an academic experience that exceeds all other school offerings. East currently utilizes curriculum that is rich in current common core standards and expectations for all students. Our teachers have been extensively trained in their curriculum areas, as well as in common core.East staff not only partake in District professional development, but also school level trainings as they pertain to our program.
East Prep is known for its focus on PBL- Project Based Learning. This is critical in a child's world as we teach them how to problem solve and develop critical thinking skills, all while learning to use and incorporate technology. The focus of PBL allows for each child to be provided with an individual learning experience that is tailored to their learning needs.
East Prep believes in hands-on, interdisciplinary learning methods. East's leaders and teachers have experienced this first hand in public, private and charter school environments.  Most schools and teachers have also witnessed the benefits of hands-on learning through individual and group projects, and know the value of engaging, challenging projects and interdisciplinary activities that enrich classroom instruction and curriculum.

PBS
What is School-wide Positive Behavior Support?
PBS is our school-wide discipline plan and the way of work to monitor behavior. The PBS goals are to increase the number of students being successful and to reduce the number of students receiving numerous referrals. Students need to be TAUGHT the correct behavior and this is best done through modeling and repeated practice. Paw prints reward students when they are showing the correct behavior. Achievement scores also increase when students are actively listening and participating in class. Paw prints are used to buy rewards throughout the year, whether it be a special show or popcorn or in the school store.
PBS...
•    Is a collaborative assessment-based process to developing effective interventions for problem behavior
•    Aims to build effective environment in which positive behavior is more effective than problem behavior.
•    Emphasizes the use of preventative, teaching, and reinforcement based strategies to achieve meaningful and durable behavior and lifestyle outcomes.
What does PBS look like in our school? 
•    Uses schoolwide expectations and rules in specific settings to teach students appropriate behavior.
•    Reward system (Paw Prints) to encourage and model appropriate behavior, and effective consequences to discourage inappropriate behavior.
•    Wildcat assemblies to reward appropriate behavior and learning gains. 
•    Big events to reward students with no referrals and events that students have saved their paw prints to attend.
•    Use data from referrals and minor infractions to target problem behavior.
Levels of PBS are: 
•    School-Wide: Procedures and processes intended for all students, staff, in specific settings across campus.
•    Classroom: Processes and procedures that reflect school-wide expectations for student behavior coupled with pre-planned strategies applied within classrooms.
