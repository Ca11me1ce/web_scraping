Successes
As a first-year school, we are breaking new ground and building our successes as we go, so continue to check back often for plenty of good news!
- During October, 2013, our  3rd graders took the Ohio Achievement Assessment (OAA) in Reading for the first time. We are proud to report that 100% of our 3rd graders enrolled in the fall met the requirements of the 3rd Grade Reading Guarantee – they scored 392 or higher!
- Scantron Assessments –
Our students in grades 2-6 take a standardized assessment on the computer in Reading and Math. This assessment is given 3 times a year to show student progress. Teachers use the data to inform instruction. This involves creating small groups, individualizing instruction and determining what standards have already been mastered.
