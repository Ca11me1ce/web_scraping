About Us
What is East Preparatory Academy?
East Preparatory Academy is an Elementary Charter School Located in Cleveland, Ohio. We opened in August 2013 serving students in grades K-8. East Preparatory Academy places high importance on safety and civility. These are core to having a good learning environment and building character.
We have a project-based curriculum philosophy that incorporates new and emerging practices and technologies such as Promethean Boards and iPads. We view the entire world as our classroom and will have a variety of face-to-face and virtual and other learning activities outside of the school.
