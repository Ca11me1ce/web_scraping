Telesis is proud to have two chapters of the National Honor Society:  National Junior Honor Society and National Honor Society.
The National Junior Honor Society is an organization for our qualifying students in Junior Academy and traditional 9th grade.  The National Honor Society is an organization for our qualifying sophomore, junior, and senior Academy students.  Membership is by invitation only to those students who meet the national qualifications set up by the National Honor Society Directors.  Student members perform chapter and individual projects for their school and community which help members develop leadership skills for the future.
National Honor Society, as well as Junior National Honor Society, has been a part of our campus for many years and each year it grows and gets better and better. Recently, National Honor Society raised enough funds ($2,500) to provide Telesis Preparatory Academy with an arched sign that they themselves designed in the school colors of black and gold. Thank you, Telesis National Honor Society.
