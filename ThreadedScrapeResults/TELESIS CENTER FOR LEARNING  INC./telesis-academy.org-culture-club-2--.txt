Character Education Culture Club is a group of Telesis students who plan and prepare to travel to places around the world and in the process learn and develop good character. The club works hard at fundraising to travel in the summer to places like Italy, Germany, and Austria planned for this summer and Costa Rica next summer. In past years, they have visited Canada and England.
