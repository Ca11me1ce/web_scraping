ECHO Charter School 21st Century
Out of School Time Programming
Rocket Learning Center 
	ECHO Charter School is in the fourth year of a five year 21st Century grant. We are part of a three school cohort overseen by PACT For Families. As part of this grant we are offering 420 hours of programming each year of after school and summer programming for youth in grades 5 to 12.
	The goals of this grant are to increase participants’ opportunities to develop and apply 21st Century skills, to increase school and community connectedness, and to increase the academic performance of participating students who are low performing or at high risk of failure in core academic classes. We also seek to incorporate opportunities for students to give input and develop responsibility, explore skills and interests, and develop social skills and positive character traits.
	Program runs Monday - Thursday from 3:30 to 5:30 with transportation at 5:30.
	Any questions please contact
