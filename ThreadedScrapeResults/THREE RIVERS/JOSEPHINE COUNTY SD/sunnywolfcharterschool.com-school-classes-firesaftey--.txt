Fire Safety
Wolf Creek Fire Volunteer Department
The students practice emergency procedures monthly with a fire drill. During this fire drill, the local Wolf Creek Fire department was at the school observing our evacuation procedures. The fire fighters were impressed with our student and staff response to the drill.
Fire Safety Lesson
After the fire drill, the fire chief instructed students about fire safety. The learned what to do in a variety of situations. Students toured the fire truck, wore their helmets and fired water out of the hoses.
 The Wolf Creek RFPD is a community based volunteer Fire Department providing Fire/EMS services to the citizens of our community. The Fire District protects 32 square miles in Josephine County. OR
