	Uncommon Schools has one recruitment process across all of its schools. In other words, you will not apply directly to one specific Uncommon school. On the common application, you can specify your regional, grade level, and subject area preferences. If you are interested in a particular school or region, please be sure to include that information on your application so our recruitment team can appropriately distribute your application!
	If you have any questions, feel free to contact us at
