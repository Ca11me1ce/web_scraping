Mission Statement
River Valley Charter School will motivate and prepare students to become
college bound within a small and nurturing educational environment
that incorporates strong family and community ties.
River Valley Charter School (RVCS) is a public charter school for grades 7 through 12, founded in 1997. Located in Lakeside, approximately twenty-five minutes from downtown San Diego, RVCS is a California Distinguished School with an Academic Performance Index (API) of 925 in 2011, which was the highest for high schools in San Diego County, and third in California of schools of similar rankings. The school has earned the highest API in San Diego County for seven years in a row and has earned a similar school ranking of 10 for five consecutive years. Our state test scores are just one reflection of our academic success.

Designed to be academically rigorous, River Valley has been fully accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges since 2002. RVCS emphasizes core classes, and each student joining us in the 9th grade is required to take four years of mathematics, social science, science, and English. Each high school core class has been designed as a college preparatory course and has been approved by the University of California to meet its A to G requirements.
River Valley’s schedule is based on a college model, in which students attend each core class twice a week for 75 minutes with the remainder of the week spent in independent study. Classes are limited to a maximum of 18 students so that instructional methods can range from lecture format to seminar type discussions and presentations. The school currently has over 200 students, nine full-time faculty, four electives teachers, and a college counselor.
Faculty at RVCS must be prepared for a variety of responsibilities. Each core teacher at the school possesses a credential, teaches in the area of their academic degree, and is NCLB compliant. Teachers are considered stakeholders who, along with parents and students, help govern the school and maintain its vision. In addition to maintaining their professional expertise, teachers are expected to keep parents involved in their child’s education through communication and use of the school website to post grades and assignments on a weekly basis.

River Valley Charter School Guiding Principles
We believe that-
Parents, students, and staff must work as a team in the educational process.
Parents, students, and staff should have the opportunity to participate in school governance.
There must be an atmosphere of mutual respect to create the optimum learning environment.
Education works best in a small community of learners with the focus on the individual.
Independent study fosters independent and responsible learners.
Students should participate in the community in order to explore possible career paths.
High academic standards are maintained by focusing on the core subjects.
The core subjects are best learned by using a variety of information resources.
