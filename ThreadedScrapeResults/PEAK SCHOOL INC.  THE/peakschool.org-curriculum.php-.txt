The PEAK School is committed to 
the Core Knowledge Sequence®
What           Is Core Knowledge?
A           Sample of the
          Core Knowledge Sequence
Core Knowledge Is...
"... a necessary foundation           for higher order reading, writing, and thinking skills" - E. D. Hirsch           Jr. 
We learn new knowledge by building           on what we already know. Students in Core Knowledge schools know a lot           because they are offered a coherent sequence of specific knowledge that           builds year by year. Built upon 
The           Four S's
, we offer a solid, sequenced, specific, and shared knowledge           foundation in the early grades, when children are most receptive and           prepared for a lifetime of learning.
