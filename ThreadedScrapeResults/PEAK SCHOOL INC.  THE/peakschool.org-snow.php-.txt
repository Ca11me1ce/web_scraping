* SNOW POLICY *
We follow Flagstaff Unified School District's snow day schedule. If FUSD announces school cancellation or delayed start, we will follow the same schedule. Delayed Start Schedule or School Cancellation will be announced over radio stations by 6:30 a.m. You can also access this information by checking 
www.fusd1.org/snow
.     On delayed start days school starts at 10:10 and 10:25 a.m. If there is a delayed start or school cancellation we will put a message on our answering machine by 6:30 a.m. (779-0771).
*PLEASE DO NOT drop your child off     on a snowy day without checking to make sure the school is open as there may     not be any school personnel at the building.* 
NOTE: The Extended School Program (ESP) will be provided on 2 hours delayed start days (7:30 a.m.), but not on school closure day.
