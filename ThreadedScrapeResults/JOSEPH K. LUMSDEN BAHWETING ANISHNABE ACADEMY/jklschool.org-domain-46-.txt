Mrs. Elfie Schwiderson
     Mrs. Schwiderson began working at JKL in September of 2000 as a Special Education teacher and a Language Arts teacher.  Prior to that, she worked at Sault High as a teacher for 9th grade English and 1st and 2nd year Spanish.  Currently at JKL, she teaches one section of 7th grade ELA (Reading and Writing, mostly), provides inclusion support for Special Education students in ELA class, and works individually or in small groups on reading skills with some students.  Mrs. Schwiderson believes that every student is an individual, with his or her own learning styles and strengths.  She enjoys seeing students blossom as readers and writers. 
     Mrs. Schwiderson grew up on a small family farm in southern Michigan.  She moved up to the U.P. after graduating from M.S.U. with a degree in Spanish and English, and a brand new teaching certificate.  A couple years later, she married a local dairy farmer.  They raised 3 daughters, two of whom still live in the area.  Mrs. Schwiderson began working as a substitute teacher after her youngest child started school.  By the mid-nineties, she worked at Sault High teaching English and Spanish, and then moved on to JKL to teach Language Arts and Special Education.  She has found this to be a very fulfilling career.
