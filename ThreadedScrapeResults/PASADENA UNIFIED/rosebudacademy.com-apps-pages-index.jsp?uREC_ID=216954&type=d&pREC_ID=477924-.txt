Parent Involvement
Pasadena Rosebud Academy is a community of success and that success can only be reached through a collaborative effort of parents and educators. Our school community is enriched by parent involvement.  Parents are encouraged to volunteer at the school site at least one hour per month.   
Other Ways to Participate:
Parents can also participate from home. Teachers need parents to type letters, create newsletters, collate papers, make phone calls, etc.
Providing teachers with supplies from their wish list will assist in creating hands-on activities for the students.
