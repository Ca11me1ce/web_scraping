Glendale
IntelliSchool’s Glendale campus opened in 2004 and is one of two campuses in the West Valley. The Glendale campus is located at 51st Avenue and Thunderbird near Arizona State University’s west campus. It is accessible from two Valley Metro bus lines: the 138 (Thunderbird West to 105th Avenue) and the 51 (51st Avenue North to Thunderbird/ASU West).
Issac Barrio has been the principal of our Glendale campus since 2016. He started his career with IntelliSchool in 2009 as a special education teacher. Principal Barrio and the staff work to create a comfortable and safe learning environment that allows students to focus on their studies and progress toward graduation. The Glendale campus, like other IntelliSchool campuses, has a zero-tolerance policy for bullying, online or off.
The Glendale campus is supported by three teachers and a student counselor. Tutors are available at this campus to assist students. In addition, the Glendale campus partners with Arizona State University’s Service Learning Program, which provides academic assistance to students throughout the year. Math intervention services are also available to students at the Glendale campus.
The Glendale campus has three daily school sessions. The morning session is from 8:00 a.m. – 12:00 p.m., the afternoon session is from 12:00 p.m. – 4:00 p.m., and the evening session is from 4:00 p.m. – 8:00 p.m. Students are asked to attend one session per day for a total of twenty school hours a week.
The Glendale campus’s largest session is its morning session with approximately 50 students. At least two staff members are available per session, but oftentimes there are three or more.
During school sessions, snacks and drinks are available to students for purchase.
The Glendale Campus is accepting new students, and we want you to be one of them.
