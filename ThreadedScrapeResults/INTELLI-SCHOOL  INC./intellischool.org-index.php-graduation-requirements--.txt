(2) – Three credits of science in preparation for proficiency at the high school level on the AIMS test.
Civics Test
In 2015, the Arizona legislature passed the American Civics Act (House Bill 2064). This bill will require students, beginning with the graduating class of 2017, to pass a civics test based on the United States Immigration and Naturalization civics questions. Students will be required to score 60% or higher in order to graduate from high school or obtain a high school equivalency certificate. 
At IntelliSchool, our goal is to help you achieve your academic goals. We individually work with students to create an academic roadmap. That roadmap is anchored by the graduation requirements from the state of Arizona.
