Academic Performance
                Pickerington Schools rely on a variety of data and indicators to gauge our performance and progress. We use this information to evolve our curriculum and teaching methods to ensure Pickerington students are receiving an engaging, innovative and holistic education that prepares them to become responsible, productive citizens.             
State Report Cards
About the Report Cards
Each year the State of Ohio releases detailed report cards for every school district in the state, as well as for individual schools.
These report cards cover a variety of measures, ranging from performance and progress on a variety of academic standards to demographic and other data.
The Ohio Department of Education’s 
Report Card Resources webpage
 provides a detailed explanation of the information contained within the state report cards, as well as the most current and archived report cards for the district and its individual buildings.
Continuous Improvement Process
Description
Pickerington Schools uses the Ohio Improvement Process (OIP) to review performance data, set goals for improvement and monitor progress.  The OIP includes a District Leadership Team (DLT) charged with leading goals and improvement efforts, Building Leadership Teams (BLTs), charged with leading improvement aligned with district goals at each of the 14 schools, and Teacher-Based Teams (TBTs) that lead improvements at the grade level or subject level.
District Improvement Goals (2017-18)
Goal one: Achievement in seventh grade reading will improve by 3.7 percent, achievement in seventh grade math will improve by 6.4 percent, and achievement in end-of-course test English language assessment 2 will improve by 3.48 percent each year for five years to reach at least 80 percent overall proficiency by the 2021-2022 school year.
Goal two: Closing the achievement gap: Students with disabilities will reach 90 percent or higher proficiency in reading and math by 2030, increasing proficiency in reading by 5.46 percent or more each year, and math by 5.15 percent or more each year according to the state report card.
Goal three: The district will achieve a 10 percent average reduction in office referrals over the next five years for economically disadvantaged students through the implementation of Positive Behavior Intervention and Supports (PBIS).
