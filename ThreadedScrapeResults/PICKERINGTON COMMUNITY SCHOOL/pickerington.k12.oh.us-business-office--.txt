Business Office (including Transportation and Food Service)
                The Pickerington Schools Business Office (which includes the Maintenance/Custodial Office) maintains the district's 14 school buildings, administration offices, maintenance building and transportation center.            
About Our Department
Our professionals maintain building areas, grounds and roadways, playground areas, and athletic fields. The Business Office also manages the tracking and record-keeping of the district’s assets, performs facility master planning and the capital improvement program for Pickerington Schools, and works to increase the energy efficiency of our buildings.
Two major roles for the Business Office are managing the student lunch program, servicing the needs of more than 10,000 students, and coordination of transportation services and our fleet of vehicles.
The district’s 
Food Services
 and 
Transportation
 are part of the Business Office functions.
