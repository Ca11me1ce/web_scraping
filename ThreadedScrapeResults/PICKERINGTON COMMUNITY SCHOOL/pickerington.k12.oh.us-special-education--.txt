Students With Disabilities
                The Special Education Department serves approximately 1,500 students who have been identified as having disabilities under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEIA 2004).

Our department includes a director, special education coordinators, intervention specialists, school psychologists, speech pathologists, paraprofessionals, occupational therapists, physical therapist, adapted physical education, assistive technology resource leader, academic/behavior coach, work-study coordinator and secretaries.            
Website Accessibility
The district strives, to the extent technologically and economically feasible, to make its websites as accessible as possible. Individuals responsible for designing, developing and producing web pages are expected to take reasonable steps to follow these guidelines to create websites that allow non-English speakers and persons with visual, auditory, and physical disabilities to access the information and content on the District’s website.
For guidance in determining whether online content is accessible, the District will consult the technical standards identified as Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 developed by the Web Accessibility Initiative (WIA) or comparable standards.
More details on website accessibility can be found under “
Web Accessibility
” on the district website and on BoardDocs in 
Board Policy 7540.02 and Administrative Guidelines 7540.02

Child Find
As required by Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA), the Pickerington Local School District is committed to the location, identification, and provision of a free and appropriate public education (FAPE) for all children between the ages of 3 and 21 having a disability and residing within our school district.
If you know of a child with a disability, or have a child suspected of having a disability, who is not currently receiving appropriate educational or related services, please contact the Pickerington Schools Office of Special Education at 614.833.2110
A Guide to Parent Rights in Special Education 
Please contact Lori Lark at 614-834-2152 if you need an adapted version of the Guide to Parent Rights in Special Education (formerly Whose Idea).
Services
Children, ages 3-21 years, who qualify for special education services under IDEIA are identified as having disabilities in one of the following areas: autism, cognitive disabilities, multiple disabilities, specific learning disabilities, other health impairment, orthopedic handicapped, severe emotional disturbance, hearing impairment, visual impairment, traumatic brain injury, speech/language disability, hearing impaired, deaf-blind, visually impaired.
Special education services for each student with disabilities are written into each student’s Individualized Education Program (IEP).  Services may be provided in a variety of settings, with the goal being to educate each student in the least restrictive environment (LRE); which means providing services in the regular classroom environment to the maximum extent possible.
In addition, students with disabilities may receive related services that could include: adapted physical education, occupational therapy, physical therapy, speech and language, audiological, interpreter, orientation and mobility, school psychological, transportation, work-study, nursing services, and aide services.
Evaluation
Each building operates under an intervention model to help determine if a student should be evaluated.  All buildings are using response to intervention (RTI) to help provide individual learning experiences in the form of classroom and small group interventions. These interventions are designed by the building RTI team to positively impact the students’ academic achievements.
Screeners are in place to look at all children to determine if there is a need for tiered intervention. Parents who have concerns about their child’s educational progress should contact their child’s school.
About the Pickerington Preschool
The Pickerington Preschool is a program that enhances and encourages learning for children with disabilities and typically developing children. We welcome children ages 3-5 years of age, while offering a range of services free to children with a qualifying disability; typical developing peers are enrolled on a tuition basis. All children are provided with a typical preschool experience and the opportunity to interact with children of all abilities.
The program is operated according to the Ohio Department of Education standards, federal mandates for the Education of Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act, and state licensure rules and regulations. Preschool teachers must hold a license for the Early Education of the Handicapped issued by the Ohio Department of Education.
The philosophy of the program emphasizes developmentally-appropriate activities.  The preschool has adopted the Creative Curriculum. Within this context, children with  disabilities receive play-based, individualized, developmentally-appropriate  interventions, including child- and teacher-directed activities. Typically-developing  children are considered to be an integral component of the program as role models for instructional and social interactions.
