Accountability
Children
Our highest accountability is to our students and their families. We set out to create a learning environment that is both challenging and enjoyable. The best learning that we have seen has both components. We ask that our parents engage in a paradigm of team education as our belief is that parents and families have the biggest impact in each child’s life.

– This document governs the operations of the school and gives a thorough overview of the mission, vision, curriculum, and overall structure of Innovations Academy. This document is 92 pages and does not include our appendix as it is too large a file to be put on our server at this time. It is well worth the read!
 School Accountability Report Card (SARC) Public schools throughout California are required to provide information about themselves to the community in the form of an annual School Accountability Report Card (SARC). These report cards provide a variety of data to allow the public to evaluate and compare schools in seven major areas:
    demographic information
    school safety and climate for learning
    academic data
    class size
    teacher and staff information
    curriculum and instruction
    fiscal and expenditure data
Following state guidelines, the report cards, issued each spring, focus on the previous academic year.
