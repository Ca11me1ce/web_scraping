Annual Pledge Drive
“Get Our Bus on the Road!”
The 2017-18 Annual Fundraising Pledge Drive was held from September 28-October 13, 2017.
Innovations Academy, like all public schools, depends on donations to supplement the funds we receive from the state.  Instead of candy bar or wrapping paper sales, IA does one annual pledge drive per year.
The last two years we raised $34,000, and we bought a bus! This year, our pledge drive funds will go toward:
Sound equipment and other needs for the Performing Arts Department
Bus driver, bus maintenance, and gas
Field trips
Our goal this year is $27,500.  Please give what you can to support the wonderful education happening at Innovations Academy! Also, let grandparents, aunts, uncles, and friends know that they can support IA as well!
If you have any questions or need additional information, email 
IAParents@innovationsacademy.org
.
Pay through our online PayPal program
 (one time payment or monthly donation)

Matching Pledge Drive
If you wish to make a MATCHING DONATION to the Pledge Drive:
Please contact the Human Resources Department at your place of employment to see if they have a matching program.
They will give you a ‘Matching Donation’ form to complete.
Once your form is completed, return the form back to your Human Resources Department.
They will send a notice to Innovations Academy stating a “Matching Donation” has been made in your name.
Our Tax ID# (or EIN) is: 26-0418421
Education Innovators Program
All year long we have our “Education Innovators Program.”  Please spread the word on our Explorations Program that brings the arts, music, media, physical education, and extra science classes to our kids.  For $250/quarter, businesses (or individuals/groups) can sponsor this great program!
