Mission & Values
Mission:
At Innovations Academy we powerfully create our lives through self-expression, compassionate connection, and purposeful learning.
Through implementation of our mission, Innovations students feel cared for in a big way.  And through this caring, students feel encouraged to explore and learn. Academic excellence is achieved when children are supported to question and search for answers. We inspire and support all of the members of our community in living this mission.
Consider that:
Teachers are guides, not guards.
Learning is a journey, not a destination.
Discovery is questioning the answers, not answering the questions.
The process is discovering ideas, not covering content.
The goal is open minds, not closed issues.
The only test is being and becoming, not remembering and reviewing.
School (or any community) is whatever we choose to make it.
With this in mind, it is our vision to:
Build on the natural love of learning that is inherent in all human beings
Strive for academic excellence through depth and meaning in learning
Foster the development of the whole child
Honor children with choices in their own learning
Help children discover their individual talents and interests
Model respect of self, others, and community
We believe:
That fun is a valuable component in the learning process
That everyone can learn and achieve
In personal responsibility and accountability
In high expectations for learning
In the value of a supportive, nurturing community
That in valuing and utilizing diversity, we can achieve common goals
Effective communication is essential
