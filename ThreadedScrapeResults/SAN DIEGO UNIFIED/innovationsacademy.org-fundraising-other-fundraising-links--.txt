The Innovations Academy Parent Association will have a table set up on Wednesdays where you can purchase gift cards for places like Starbucks, Vons, Bed, Bath & Beyond, Home Depot, Lowe’s, Wal-Mart, many local restaurants, movie theaters, Old Navy, Pottery Barn, JC Penney and iTunes.  These are great for gifts and can also be used for your everyday purchases.  These cards are also available for
 purchase online.
  You can even purchase iTunes or Starbucks “ScripNow” (instant virtual gift cards) to reload your existing account.
