This collaborative artwork was inspired by Gustav Klimt’s powerful Tree of Life painting and created by students of the HLC for their Shakespeare play.
Inquiry Based Project Learning…
It’s not just about ideas, it’s about making ideas happen!
“We learn more by looking for the answer to a question and not finding it than we do from learning the answer itself.”
-Lloyd Alexander
“I cannot teach anybody anything, I can only make them think.”
-Socrates
“Childhood’s work is learning, and it is in his play…that the child works at his job.”
-Caroline Pratt
“Children…need most of the same things adults need–consideration, respect for their work, the knowledge that they and the things they do are taken seriously.”
―

I Learn from Children
