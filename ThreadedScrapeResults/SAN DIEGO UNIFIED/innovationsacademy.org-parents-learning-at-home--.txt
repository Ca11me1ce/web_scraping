Learning at Home
At Innovations Academy we have a “No Meaningless Homework Policy.” This policy is designed so that parents, who are the primary educators of their children, can utilize family time in a way that works for their individual families. We recognize that human beings, by nature, learn all of the time. Learning is best supported by a variety of activities.  Here is a list of ways that families can use evening time to support learning.

All Around Good Learning
Free Play: bike riding, block building, digging in the dirt
“Play Dates” and hanging out. It is a shame that many of us can’t or won’t let our children walk to their friends’ homes to play. However, free play with friends is still very important in the learning process. Invite a child or children from school, church, enrichment class that your child speaks fondly about over to play or meet them at the park. Let the children decide  how the play will go. You will probably have to intervene to help them negotiate decisions but they will benefit from the experience.
Go for a leisurely walk. The learning will happen through observations and conversation in this get away moment.
Go to the public library. Browse the books, talk about how to find a book, find a favorite book for each of you.
Play a game: card games, board games, guessing games. Just play!
