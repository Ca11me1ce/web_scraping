    “I love working at Enlace because it has literally changed my life. My co-workers are my family, my brothers and sisters.”  
— Darnell Benson, 6th Grade Teacher
    “What brought me to Enlace, and what keeps me coming back are the challenges and rewards of meeting students where they are and taking them further than I ever thought possible!”  
— Jeannie TeKolste, Special Needs Coordinator
    “Enlace is my second home.  I say that because as a mother and a teacher, there is no other school I could imagine working at or sending my son to.  My coworkers are amazing, caring, dedicated teachers who spend countless time working to help out our most needy students, and yet, are also there to lift each other up when they need it.  The mission of our school aligns directly to my personal beliefs, and  while the work we do is at times is hard, it is only hard because it is worth it. The support and relationships with families also make it worth it.  I love the staff, the students, and the families of this school, and because of this I love Enlace.  
”  
— Crystal Meiller, 5th Grade Teacher
