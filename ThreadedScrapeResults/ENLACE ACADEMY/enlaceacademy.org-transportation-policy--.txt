Enlace Academy Bus Transportation Policy
I.
Purpose
It is the policy of Enlace Academy to provide transportation to students in a manner that will protect their health, welfare, and safety.

This policy is to inform students, parents, and bus drivers of the rules and regulations of school bus transportation at Enlace Academy.
II.
Conduct on Bus
Enlace Academy’s school bus safety rules are to be posted on every bus. If these rules are broken, the Enlace Academy’s discipline procedures are to be followed. Consequences are progressive and may include suspension or termination of bus privileges. It is the school bus driver's responsibility to report unacceptable behavior to the school principal or assistant principal using the bus referral form.

3.
Relations with Parents: Drivers must deal with students and parents in a polite, professional and considerate manner.
4.
Student Discipline: Although drivers are responsible for maintaining order on the bus, drivers must always remember that the types of actions they may use are governed by school district policy. Drivers must never, under any circumstances, use corporal punishment. Drivers have no authority to deny a child the privilege of riding the bus, or drop the student at other than the designated stop. Any denial of bus riding privileges can come only from the school authorities.
