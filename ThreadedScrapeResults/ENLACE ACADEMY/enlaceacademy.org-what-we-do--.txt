Our beginnings
Enlace Academy is a grassroots charter school that launched in 2013 on the west side of Indianapolis.  The name Enlace derives from the Spanish word for link or connection because the school seeks to be the hub of community for her families and create meaningful connections with community partners so that our whole families can be healthy and happy.
