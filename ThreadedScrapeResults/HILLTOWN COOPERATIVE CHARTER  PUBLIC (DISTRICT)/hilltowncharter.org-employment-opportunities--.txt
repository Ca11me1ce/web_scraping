Hilltown Teaching Fellowship
The Hilltown Teaching Fellowship is a two-year program offered by Smith College and the Hilltown Cooperative Charter Public school that offers an intensive internship in multi-grade classrooms, Kindergarten through Grade Eight. In unique and select instances, a one year internship may be available.
Teaching Fellows work the full school year with the supervising teacher (192 days), performing essential functions and working the hours of a teacher, provided they do not conflict with the required course load at Smith College. Daily work hours are generally 8 am-4 pm, with occasional meetings past 4 pm.
Teaching Fellows assist the classroom teacher and other staff in facilitating the creation of a respectful, safe, and nurturing classroom environment. Fellows plan and facilitate lessons in all curricular areas on a weekly basis. They work individually with assigned students and with small groups on activities planned by the special education and classroom teachers. Fellows develop and maintain good working relationships with families of classroom students, participate in professional development activities and staff meetings, and provide observational feedback on student performance/behavior to teachers.
Teaching Fellows manage the whole class when needs arise taking the teacher away from the class. They prepare materials needed for lessons as assigned by the classroom teacher, perform classroom clerical duties including correcting and documenting student work, and supervise and monitor students during lunch and recess as assigned.
Hilltown Teaching Fellows will serve their first year in a mixed-age classroom, and their second year in a different mixed-age classroom. Fellows will leave the program with teaching experience at four different grade levels. The Fellowship pays a $10,000 annual stipend.
