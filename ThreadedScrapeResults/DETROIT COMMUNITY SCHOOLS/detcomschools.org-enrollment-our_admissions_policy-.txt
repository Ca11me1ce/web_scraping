Detroit Community Schools District follows open enrollment proceduresrequired of all Public School Academies. Each year, students from over60 different public schools, charter schools, home schools and privateschools merge to create our educational community. This diversity, alongwith the various economic and cultural backgrounds, creates a rich andinspiring learning opportunity.
 It is our belief that familymembers play an integral role in every child’s education. We encourageall parents to support school events, become involved in the ParentOrganization maintain regular contact with staff and to endorse theschool’s mission and policies.
Detroit Community Schools, inaccordance with state law, does not consider academic ability ascriteria for enrollment.  Admissions are determined by a random lotterydrawing held each year.  If student demand exceeds student space,applicants are placed on a wait list. The wait list status is determinedby the grade applied for and the date and time the application isreceived.
In our effort to keep families together, DetroitCommunity Schools will give preference to siblings of currently enrolledstudents. All siblings seeking enrollment must complete an application.To be considered, the applicant must live in the same household as thecurrently enrolled student and be a biological sibling, a sibling bymarriage or a court appointed sibling.  Proof of guardianship isrequired.
