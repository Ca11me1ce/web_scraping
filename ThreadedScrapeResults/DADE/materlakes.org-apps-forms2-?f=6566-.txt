- Be advised that when requesting unofficial or official copies, IT IS THE STUDENT'S RESPONSIBILITY TO PICK UP THE COPIES IN THE MAIN OFFICE. We will not send transcripts to any university per your request, since they have a cost (this excludes students out of the county or out of state), unless the University itself requests them. 
- Unofficial or Official requested transcripts will not be printed out until the student is present in the office picking them up.
- Be aware that some Colleges and Universities only process transcripts electronically.
- Transcripts are made every Friday at 10:00 AM.
- Official copies have a cost of $3.00/copy.
- Please only send one email request.
