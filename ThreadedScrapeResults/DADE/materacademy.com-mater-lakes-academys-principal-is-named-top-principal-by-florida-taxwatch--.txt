Miami, FL, Monday, April 23, 2018 – Principal, Rene F. Rovirosa of Mater Lakes Academy was named one of the top nine principals in the State of Florida, by Florida TaxWatch, and one of the top three in the high school division in August.  On Thursday, April 19th, Florida Tax Watch held their Principal Leadership Award dinner, and amongst the three nominees in the high school category he was awarded the top principal.
Florida TaxWatch is an independent, nonpartisan, nonprofit taxpayer research institute.  According to their website, “Its research recommends productivity enhancements and explains the statewide impact of fiscal and economic policies and practices on citizens and businesses.”
Florida TaxWatch established their Principal Leadership Awards Program in 2014.  The criteria used to name the top 3 principals per grade division (elementary, middle, and high school) is not done through a nomination basis, but it is data driven.  Florida TaxWatch basis their criteria on data received from the Florida Department of Education, using assessment scores, their learning gains, and the percentage of students that are ELL, SPED, and economically disadvantaged and their progress.  Mater Lakes Academy has 4% learning gain in English and Language Arts and a 14% learning gain in Mathematics.  Mater Lakes Academy exceeded both the state and district percentage of proficiency at 71%.
“I am honored, there are no other words to describe it, but just that I am honored,” said Principal Rene F. Rovirosa.  “I truly feel that they key to a better community is quality education, and that is what we are providing because this award is not just mine but all of Mater Lakes.”  Earlier in the school year, Mr. Rovirosa was also awarded the 2017 Charter School Champion Leader Award by the Florida Consortium of Public Charter Schools.
Mater Lakes Academy is a Miami-Dade County Public Charter School, with students enrolled in 6th – 12th grade.  Mater Lakes Academy has been open since the 2006-2007 academic school year, and is currently in its 12th year under the direction of Principal Rene F. Rovirosa, and is an A school for both the middle school and the high school.  For more information, visit the school’s website at www.materlakes.org.
