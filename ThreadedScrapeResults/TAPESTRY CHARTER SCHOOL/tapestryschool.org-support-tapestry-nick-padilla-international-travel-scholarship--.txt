Nick Padilla International Travel Scholarship
This scholarship celebrates the memory of a former Tapestry student and traveler, Nick Padilla.  Nick was a person who loved being outdoors and who saw the beauty of nature.  He had a unique way of looking at the world and he sought to capture that view with photography. 
The Nick Padilla International Travel Scholarship will be awarded to a Tapestry student who best embodies Nick's spirit and interest in photography.   
The scholarship will cover the enrollment expense for a Tapestry trip to Europe in the spring of 2017.
Applications will open September 1st annually.
(Donations made after 4/12/16 will be used to cover the expenses of the scholarship recipient for the 2019 trip.)
Thank you for your support!
