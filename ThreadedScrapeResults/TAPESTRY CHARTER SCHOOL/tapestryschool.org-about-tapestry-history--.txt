History
Tapestry Charter School is an arts-integrated, K-12 
Expeditionary Learning
, tuition-free, public school located in the city of Buffalo, NY. Founded by passionate individuals who shared a commitment to choice, accountability, and excellence, Tapestry received approval from the 
State University of New York Board of Trustees
 to open in September 2001.
In 2001, Tapestry opened with 100 K-4 students, supporting administration, faculty and staff, all sharing a common vision.  The school grew one grade per year, becoming a full K-12 school in the 2009-10 school year with 515 students. 98 percent of Tapestry’s first senior class graduated in June 2010. All seniors in all three of Tapestry's graduating classes have been accepted to college.
By school year 2013-14, Tapestry  doubled the size of its lower school, serving 450 students grades K-8; the full K-12 program now serves almost 800 students. Since 2011, the full K-12 community has shared a new, state-of-the-art, purpose-built campus at 65 Great Arrow Avenue in Buffalo, NY.
Tapestry Charter School has become a name that is synonymous with student engagement, faculty and administrative innovation, and parent involvement.  Tapestry provides a challenging and rigorous educational environment that emphasizes the values of appreciation, integrity, compassion, service, quality, responsibility, perseverance and respect.The success of the school programs at every level is evidenced by the popularity of the admissions lottery each year; many more applications are received than can be accommodated.
