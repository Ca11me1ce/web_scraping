Family Wellness Night
The Tapestry Wellness Team would like to invite the ThunderHawk community to our first annual Family Wellness Night. The evening will include an opportunity to participate in fitness activities with your entire family. We will have Tapestry staff and outside community organizations offering fitness sessions and activities in our two Tapestry gyms. The folks from First Tee and Soccer for Success will be in attendance.  Local community businesses and organizations in the field of wellness will also be in attendance.  
Where: Tapestry Charter School, 65 Great Arrow
              Lower School gym, High School gym and Cafeteria
The Tapestry Food Service Team is especially excited to showcase some of the healthy and nutritious menu items we offer at school for our lunch service program.  Every day we serve a variety of fresh, seasonal and even locally grown (weather permitting) fruits and vegetables, as well as a healthy variety of whole grains and lean proteins that help student’s mind and bodies succeed in school
Feel free to choose one of the activities, or participate in all of them!  Please join us for this night of Family fun!
