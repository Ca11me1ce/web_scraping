VISITING OPPORTUNITIES
Shadow Day – a day for current 8th graders to be Flying Squirrels for the day. Your student will be paired with an LSA student and attend classes; a regular LSA school day. Shadows are encouraged to participate and engage in class. This is an awesome opportunity for your child to experience LSA! Once the days are full, the page is removed from our website.
Parent Interest Meetings – interest meetings are scheduled for prospective parents and students. These meetings are provided to inform families and students who LSA is, what our focus is and what you can expect. There is also a time for questions and answers. 
School Tours – tours are typically scheduled mid to late Winter to coordinate during Open Enrollment. The one-hour tour is held during the school day to give prospective parents and students an opportunity to see the school in action. These tours are most beneficial for parents and students who did not get an opportunity to participate in a Shadow Day or Parent Interest Meeting. Space and the number of tours is limited
to minimize interruption.
GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS – a total of 27 credits are required to graduate; an option for students is to concentrate in on area of art for an endorsement.
