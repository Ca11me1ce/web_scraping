Administrative Assistant
Sandy Thao
sthao@nobleacademy.us
Education: 
I graduated from the University of Minnesota – Duluth with a Bachelor of Science degree in Biology and a minor in Chemistry.  
Experience:
I first volunteered at Noble Academy for a couple of years and then took a part-time job position as a summer helper for the office staff.  Since then I continued to stay with Noble Academy and am now an Administrative Assistant.  
Reason for working in Education: 
My father once said that, “Education is the key to success.”
Interesting Facts and Hobbies:
On my free time, I love spending time with my niece and nephews.  When I’m not spending time with them, I do enjoy cooking, sleeping, reading, swimming, watching movies, and catching up on television shows.  On most Tuesdays when I get the chance and if there’s a good movie, my love and I enjoy going to Marcus Theater for their $5 movie deals.  We always get their #1 combination of unlimited refills on popcorn and pop with the additional pretzel bits on the side.
