Drive Safe!
Student safety is in the driver's hands. Leave the house early enough so you are not rushed. Stay in line while flowing through the parking lot to the "stop, drop, and go" curb. Pull up, as far as possible, while wishing your child a good day. Be cautious as you drive to and from school. Children are precious!
