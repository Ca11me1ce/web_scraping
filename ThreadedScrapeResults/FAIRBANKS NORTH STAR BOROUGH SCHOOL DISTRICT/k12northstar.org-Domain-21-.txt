Bicycle Safety Rodeo on Wednesday, May 9th 2018 at Ticasuk Brown
Elementary. Students will learn about safe riding practices and will complete a bicycle course practicing safe riding skills.
Students, parents or guardians need to bring the bicycle and helmet to school that morning. Please let your teacher know if your student needs to
borrow a bike that day. IF you have extra bicycles that you can loan to the school please let us know as well. 
Goldstream Sports will be at the school to help pump up tires and adjust brakes. ( No repairs, such as fixing tires will be done at that time.)
WE NEED VOLUNTEERS in order to make this day a success. Volunteers help guide the students through the stations as well as assist with pumping up
tires in the morning.
