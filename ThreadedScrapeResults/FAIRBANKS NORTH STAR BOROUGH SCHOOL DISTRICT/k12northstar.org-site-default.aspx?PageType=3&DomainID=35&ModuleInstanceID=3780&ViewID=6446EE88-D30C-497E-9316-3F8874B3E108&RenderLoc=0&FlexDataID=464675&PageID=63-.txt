            Assembly considering increasing minimum level of local funding for 2018-19 school district budget        
On Thursday, April 26, the Fairbanks North Star Borough Assembly is considering a resolution to set the minimum amount of money available as local funding for the school district’s 2018-2019 budget.
A proposed substitute resolution by Assembly Member Matt Cooper has been submitted that would set the minimum funding level at $50 million instead of the $41 million proposed in the original resolution. The School Board’s recommended budget for 2018-2019 requests $50,045,000 from the Borough.
 According to the resolution, the Assembly recognizes that “setting the minimum contribution at a level substantially lower than the amount likely to be funded may unnecessarily and negatively impact School District employees.” The resolution also states the Assembly Finance Committee accepts the $50,045,000 local contribution to education proposed in Mayor Kassel’s recommended borough budget. The recommended budget will go before the full Assembly for approval on May 3.
Anyone interested in advocating for education funding can express their support for the $50 million minimum funding level in the proposed substitute Resolution 2018-17 via an email to 
assembly@fnsb.us
 or in person on Thursday, during citizen’s comments. The citizen’s comments period before the vote on the resolution is from 6:00 - 6:50 p.m. The sign-up sheet for citizen’s comments is made available at the Borough Administration Center beginning at noon on Thursday.
