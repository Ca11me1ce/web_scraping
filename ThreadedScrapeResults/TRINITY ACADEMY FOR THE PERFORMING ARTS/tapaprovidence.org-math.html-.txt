	Mathematics
The Mathematics Department is committed to developing and enhancing our students’ ability to think abstractly and problem solve.  As mandated by the state of Rhode Island, all students are required to complete four years of Mathematics.  A traditional Mathematics course is used at TAPA beginning from basic middle school math curricula to Algebra 1 in Freshman year through Pre-Calculus in Junior year. 
The Mathematics curriculum includes the following components in each grade level:
Basic mathematical computations
Interpretations of mathematical concepts to address real world problems
A focus on PARCC questions intertwined with current curricula and assessments to ensure preparation
All courses will require students to complete summer packet
Admission to class may be based on success in previous courses, test scores and teacher recommendations.

Bianca grew up in Providence creating films and doing comedy improvisational acting at Everett, a local non-profit arts company and school. 
In 2012 she received her BFA from Emerson College’s film program. Her films have been shown at various film festivals including the Cannes Short Film Corner, The "No Time Left" festival in Paris, the Council for Social Work Education Festival and the Emerson Los Angeles Film Festival where she won the award for "women in film". 
Bianca's dedication to Providence youth and helping them reach their goals brought her to the education field, and particularly, math as it is a subject many struggle with. She is currently working toward her Masters in Urban Education at Providence College and looks forward to continuing to find ways to bring the arts and education together
