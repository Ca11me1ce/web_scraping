Theatre
The Theatre program at TAPA is designed to teach, train and inspire youth with the history, theory and practice of the art of play. The program teaches both theatrical education and real world application of the art and pushes the students to use theatre as an outlet to express themselves and gain skills, professionalism and confidence.
Coursework begins with many early forms of theatre as well the core foundations of acting. Students move on to covering areas such as Greek Theatre, Commedia Dell'arte, Shakespeare, Musicals, International Theatre, Experimental Theatre, Melodrama, Comedy, Farce, Long Form Improv Stage Combat, etc. We also have a Technical Theatre curriculum that includes coursework in stagecraft, lighting, sewing, puppetry, conceptual design and stage management. In addition to this, the department puts on several productions a year and competes in performance competitions as well.
The culmination of all of the subjects and experiences is each student then writes, directs and produces their own short play during their Senior Year. All of this work is covered in a rigorous curriculum that includes arts integration with their core classes while also adhering to the National Core Arts Standards.
Our students are held to a high standard and have achieved many accolades and experiences. Students have won multiple Shakespeare competitions, worked directly with many local theaters and one of our students even performed for Lin-Manuel Miranda. This department is only beginning to scratch the surface of what our students will accomplish and we look forward to education, inspiring and assisting in our students path of success.
