Dance
The dance program at Trinity Academy for the Performing Arts is a comprehensive program which focuses on both dance technique (Ballet, Modern, West-African, Latin, Global Traditions, Hip-Hop, Aesthetics of the Oppressed) as well as using dance (Choreographing, Composing, Devising, and Performing) as a tool for inquiry into contemporary themes and questions that require interdisciplinary knowledge, such as power, oppression, balance, beauty, representation, independence, movement, and transformation.
​Dance students will explore creative expression and inquiry through movement; awareness of space, time, and energy as design factors in dance composition; anatomy; and the development of self-confidence through the use of the body as an instrument to negotiate, question, and gain insight. In addition, students will learn the history of multiple forms of dance and formulate their own individual appreciation and philosophy of Dance as a contemporary art form.
Dance Majors and Minors at TAPA will develop kinesthetic awareness, proper body alignment, physical strength, flexibility, endurance, and care for the body. Dance students will work collaboratively to build technique in multiple genres, choreograph/curate original work, and critique professional dance performances. The essential questions and curricular objectives for Dance students across grade levels are supported by the RI Department of Education Grade Span Expectations in Dance (RI GSEs).
