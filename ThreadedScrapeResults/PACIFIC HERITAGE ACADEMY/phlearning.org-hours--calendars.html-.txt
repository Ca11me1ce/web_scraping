2017-2018 SCHOOL YEAR CALENDAR
2018-2019 school year calendar
We are Voyagers like ancestors of old. We are strong, inventive, courageous, and filled with wonder. 
Sailing seas of knowledge, we seek understanding and use it with compassion. 
Looking forward, we honor the past to better see our future. We will find hope and success in spite of wind and change. 
With our eyes to the heavens, fixed on guiding lights, we know ourselves, our space, our time. 
We will seek, we will find, we will know new horizons. 
We are Mighty Voyagers!
