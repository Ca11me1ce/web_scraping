About Us
South Pointe High School is a public charter school located in south/central Phoenix. Like traditional public schools, our doors are open to ALL students free-of-charge. We are AdvancED accredited and adhere to the same high academic standards set for all public schools by the Arizona State Department of Education. Our students graduate with diplomas that lead them into college careers, exciting job opportunities, and military service. We are proud of each and every one of our students and feel that we offer them a richly rewarding, positive academic experience.
In Arizona, an "open enrollment" policy exists that allows students and their parents to enroll in any school within or outside of their current school district. If you are looking for a safe, welcoming, community-oriented high school with high academic standards, please stop by. We are located on the east side of Central Ave, just south of Baseline. 
While you are here, we also invite you to visit 
South Pointe Elementary School

South Pointe Junior High School
