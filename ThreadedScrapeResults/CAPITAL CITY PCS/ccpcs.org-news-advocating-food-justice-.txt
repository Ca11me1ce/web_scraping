Advocating for Food Justice
On Thursday, April 12th, Capital City’s Class of 2019, in partnership with the University of the District of Columbia, hosted the 4th annual DC Food Justice Youth Summit. After completing an in-depth expedition studying the complex ways that our food systems impact communities and the environment, 11th graders from Capital City presented their findings and solutions on various issues related to food justice. They were joined by other DC youth including students from Capitol Hill Day School, who also presented, and Dunbar High School. This 11th grade expedition is one of only 18

 awards, a recognition of the impact our teachers and students have in transforming our community.
For the past four years, Capital City has organized this summit, a full-day conference in which DC-based middle and high school students lead interactive sessions for their peers and community members. Youth-led workshops this year focused on school kitchens, food waste, regenerative farming, homelessness and composting. 
Courtland Milloy, columnist with The Washington Post, attended various workshops and spoke with our students about their recommendations for sustainable and equitable food systems. In his story, “
