Frequently Asked Questions
"What I like most about Capital City is it is a community that fosters character, independent thinking and social consciousness." 
— Patrice McCoy-Rogers, Capital City parent
I want my child to attend Capital City. How do I register?
Capital City enrolls new students through a random lottery process. The application to enter the lottery for the upcoming school year is available at 
myschooldc.org
. Any student who is a resident of the District of Columbia is eligible to apply. If your child is awarded a space, you will be contacted with procedures for enrolling your child.
How old does a student need to be to enter PK-3, PK-4 or K?
To enter PK-3 for the 2017-2018 school year, your student must be 3 years old by September 30, 2017.
To enter PK-4 for the 2017-2018 school year, your student must be 4 years old by September 30, 2017.
To enter K for the 2017-2018 school year, your student must be 5 years old by September 30, 2017.
Do you maintain a waiting list after the lottery?
Yes. Students are admitted in the order of the waiting list. As spaces are filled, those who remain on the waiting list will move forward when current students withdraw or waiting list families accept or decline an offer of admission.
How long will my student stay on the waiting list? Do I need to apply every year?
The waiting list is only valid for one school year. You must apply every year through the My School DC common lottery at 
myschooldc.org
.
How will you contact me if an opening becomes available for my student?
We will make every effort to contact you by telephone. It is very important to contact us if any of your telephone numbers change. You are also encouraged to contact the My School DC hotline at 202-888-6336 to learn your student’s current status on the waiting list.
Do you offer sibling preference?
We offer preference to the siblings of enrolled students.
I have more than one child on the waiting list. What happens if one of my children is offered a space? Will the others be offered a space?
Once a student receives a space and is enrolled, all qualified siblings are moved to the next sibling offered position for their grade based on their random lottery number.
Is preference given for those who live in the neighborhood?
No. As a charter school, we are required to open admission to all students residing in Washington, D.C. without regard to neighborhood.
We applied online but we were never able to visit the school for an open house. Can we make an appointment for a tour?
Once an offer of admission is extended, Capital City will offer your family a tour of the school. You and/or your student may be asked to attend additional orientation sessions during the summer such as:
Eagles Camp, mandatory training for incoming Middle School students (grades 5-8)
New Student Orientation, mandatory orientation for students entering the High School
Will my child be able to visit?
Your child is welcome to accompany you during our open houses. For middle and high school students, we are able to arrange a half day to shadow a student. For more information, please contact the Development Office at
 development@ccpcs.org
.
