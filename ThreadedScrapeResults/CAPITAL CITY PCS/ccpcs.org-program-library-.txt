Library
The Capital City library serves all students in grades PreK-12. The two-floor, 5,250 square foot library was designed by a Capital City team of librarians, teachers, parents and administrators to be the heart of the school with 
over 14,000 books; AV equipment such as cameras, video cameras, and document cameras; and a state-of-the-art makerspace.
Washington Nationals 1st baseman 
Ryan Zimmerman kicked off the 2017 DC Public Library Summer Reading Program
 in our library. He read to students and emphasized the importance of summer learning.
The 2016 Opportunity Tour
 started here! The U.S. Department of Education spoke with students and staff about our commitment to computer science and technology literacy and toured our 
makerspace
.
Capital City was one of only three public schools selected for a national photoshoot to showcase 
deeper learning in action
 during the 2016-17 school year. The library was an ideal location for the project. 
Our library's mission is to develop students who are prepared for the demands of the 21st century, and provide teachers with a robust collection of relevant instructional assets. Through the mastery of our Books, Information, and Technology curriculum, students will be empowered to become creative and critical thinkers, lifelong readers, and effective collaborators.
