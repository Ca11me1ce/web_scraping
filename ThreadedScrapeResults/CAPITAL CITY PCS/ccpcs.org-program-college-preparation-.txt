College Preparation
“At Capital City, I saw ample evidence that this is a school that cares deeply about academic rigor and learning. In classroom after classroom, students were engaged in rich, multi-dimensional projects that helped them to deeply understand important issues and topics.”
— Denis Udall, The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation
We take seriously the responsibility of preparing all students for college success. At Capital City, college preparation involves preparing students academically, socially and emotionally for the real demands of college and supporting students and their families in navigating the application process.
Counseling and Support
We employ two full-time college counselors who work with students and their families beginning in 9th grade. We plan trips for students to visit colleges and universities and participate in college fairs. College readiness support is offered through advisory in 9th-12th grades, and students take a senior seminar in their 12th grade year focused on college preparation. We offer SAT and PSAT prep courses for students both in the summer and during the school year. 
One of our greatest accomplishments is that 100% of our graduates have been accepted to college.

Curriculum
All Capital City students engage in a challenging, college preparatory curriculum. We offer advanced placement courses including: AP Calculus, AP Language, AP Literature and Composition, AP Spanish Language and Culture, AP Human Geography, AP Environmental Science, AP Physics, and AP Statistics. Other core courses at Capital City are offered with an open honor option where students who elect to take courses with honors extend their learning by completing additional course requirements.
Students in all grades complete a portfolio of work that provides evidence of mastery of learning targets. At the end of each semester, students present portfolios to their advisors and families in student-led portfolio conferences. All 10th grade students must complete and present a more rigorous passage portfolio to a panel comprised of faculty and community members. Successful passage requires that students demonstrate mastery of skills, strong communication, and understanding of themselves as a learner.
As seniors, students design and execute their own personal learning expeditions, a requirement of graduation. As part of the process, students complete an in-depth research paper and annotated bibliography, conduct fieldwork, meet with experts, and design an authentic product to benefit the community. Seniors present the work of their expedition to a panel prior to graduation.
College Ready Spotlight
Class of 2017 Salutatorian, Adeline Linzau, wrote an inspiring essay for the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools' 2017 #30DaysofGrad campaign. In her piece, she discusses how her fourteen years at Capital City equipped her with the skills and experiences needed for college. Adeline wrote, “The thing about being a student at Capital City is that you start preparing for college the moment you walk through the door.”
