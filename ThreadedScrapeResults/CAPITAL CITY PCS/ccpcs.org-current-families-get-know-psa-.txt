Get to Know the PSA
Every Capital City parent is part of the PSA!
In 2008, our Parent School Association (PSA) was formed to better support children, strengthen the home-school partnership and to sponsor events that promote learning and build community. In the past year alone, PSA leadership organized and sponsored many events including the fall camping trip, spring fair, teacher and staff appreciation luncheons and other initiatives to support our school.
Since its inception, the PSA has been integral in supporting the school’s mission and the efforts of teachers and staff. We are grateful for the leadership, participation, and hard work of so many parents in building and supporting our Capital City PSA. 
Read the PSA Guidelines (Bylaws) here.

Parent School Association Events
If you are a parent and would like to volunteer at one of these events, contact our development office at 
development@ccpcs.org
 to be connected to the PSA leaders.
Throughout the year, the Parent School Association sponsors programs and events that help parents and children become an active part of the life of Capital City, while supporting its educational mission. Below are some of the events that the PSA has organized or supported in the past:
SEPTEMBER
Back-to-school Picnic: 
Parents help set up and clean up, and lead games for the kids.
OCTOBER
Camping Trip:
 Capital City families explore nature and spend the night in cabins. Volunteers help organize the event and coordinate activities.
Fiesta Latina 
(Hispanic Heritage Month Celebration): This event was initiated by staff at Capital City in 2013. Volunteers help with the planning for this event, coordinate with school staff and recruit other volunteers.
NOVEMBER
Parent Teacher Conference Day “Brunch” for Teachers:
 Parents bring in snacks and brunch items for teachers on the parent teacher conference day.
Book Fair:
 The book fair not only raises money for the school library, but gives parents and children an opportunity to celebrate reading and the world of literature. Volunteers help set up the event, work the sale each day, and dismantle the cases at the end.
International Potluck:
 Held during the week of the book fair, our international potluck celebrates the great diversity of Capital City’s community. Families provide meals from their home country or favorite ethnic dish to share during this evening event.
Fall Fun Day:
 A full day of cookie decorating, singing, face painting, story time, musical chairs, and other fun activities. PSA volunteers help recruit and manage volunteers and assist school staff with organizing this event.
FEBRUARY
Parent Teacher Conference Day “Brunch” for Teachers:
 Parents bring in snacks and brunch items for teachers on the parent teacher conference day.
Black History Month Celebration:
 Capital City students, staff and families share readings, music, and poetry to celebrate Black History Month. Volunteers help with setup and cleanup.
Ice Skating Day at Fort Dupont:
 This year we have proposed February 19 (Presidents' Day) to meet and go skating. This is a family-friendly outing.
MARCH
Family and Friends Giving Fund - Spring Campaign:
 This annual fundraising effort for the school is parent-led and seeks 100% family participation. Parents are needed to lead classroom or grade-level giving. Families also plan special events for their respective classrooms during this month.
Lower School Grandparents/Grand-friends Day: 
 Lower School students’ grandparents and older friends of the family spend the morning visiting the school and enjoying brunch. Parent volunteers organize the event and help set up, welcome and guide grandparents, and clean up.
