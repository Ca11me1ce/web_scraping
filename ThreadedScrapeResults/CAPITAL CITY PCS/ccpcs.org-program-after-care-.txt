2017-2018 Program Information
Capital City Public Charter School’s After Care Program is a tuition-based program geared for Pre-K3 through 8th grade students. The purpose of the program is to provide a safe, nurturing, and engaging environment for our students while their parents are working.

The aim is a stimulating environment that is also relaxing and fun for students.
