Instructional Approach
“Schools have so many great intentions for the places they want to be, and the culture they want to have, but Capital City is the first school I have ever been a part of that lives through intention. Teachers are pushed in their practice to embrace diversity in every sense of the word and to strive for excellence through creative, engaging work that enriches our students and propels them to succeed.” 
— Amanda Yeager, 6th Grade Math and Science Teacher
At Capital City, the core elements of the instructional approach are consistent across the grades of our PreK – 12 program. 
These core elements include:
Deeper Learning
Research and evidence show that there is a critical set of skills that students will need to succeed in a changing world. These deeper learning skills — critical thinking, problem solving, collaboration, communication and learning how to learn — are the core focus of instruction at Capital City. Through them we build a foundation in traditional academic subjects and foster an understanding of grade level content and skills.

How Capital City Public Charter School Provides Its Students with a Deeper Learning Expedition
” to learn more. Watch 
EL Education's video
 to see one of our approaches in action. 
Authentic Experiences
We believe that learning should be compelling for students and connected to the real world. Students in all grades engage in in-depth studies called 
learning expeditions
.
Through expeditions, students participate in fieldwork, meet with experts, engage in research and in turn become experts themselves. Students share their expertise with others through projects and by presenting their work to a real audience.
Watch this video
 to see three of our 3rd graders using their knowledge to advocate for the DC Council to divest funds from banks that support the Dakota Access Pipeline. Related to the 3rd grade expedition on the history of the Americas and natural resources, our students examined multiple perspectives on the controversy before testifying on May 4, 2017. 
Personalized Instruction
Our students are well known by their teachers and peers and are challenged and supported in their learning. Low student to teacher ratios, daily advisory or class meetings, on-going assessment of progress and strong parent-school collaboration support our approach to personalization.
Capital City classes use the workshop model to tailor instruction for individual students. A class typically begins with a whole-class mini-lesson in which new material is introduced. The bulk of the period is devoted to working on assignments and projects where students work independently or in small groups while teachers provide targeted assistance and assess student progress. At the end of the period, the entire class reconvenes to debrief the day’s work, share what they learned, and raise questions or topics for further investigation.
A Whole Child Approach
We believe in educating the whole child. We focus on a strong 
social curriculum
 where students develop social skills within the context of a nurturing community. We also believe the 
arts
 are vital to our whole child approach and support creative expression in all grades. Beginning in Pre-K, all students are provided instruction in visual arts, music and drama, and arts are integrated into the core curriculum.  We also support the health and wellness of students through a comprehensive sports and fitness program, health education, and building a healthy environment.
