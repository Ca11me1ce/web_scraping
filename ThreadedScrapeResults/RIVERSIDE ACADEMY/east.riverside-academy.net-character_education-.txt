School Character Traits
We   believe that character education is a basic ingredient in the education   process and this component hasn’t received the needed attention in the   traditional educational system. Therefore, the Academy staff has   identified the following character traits as important for the   development of responsible citizenship. These character traits are   taught and practiced throughout the school year in a variety of specific   lessons and settings.
Respect - 
Respect  is the foundation for a safe and peaceful school environment  that is  conducive to learning. Respect may be further divided into  respect for  oneself, respect for others and respect for property
Responsibility - 
We  are responsible for our own thoughts, actions and feelings, taking   pride in our efforts and successes. It also means that we admit when   there is need for improvement. We apply what we have learned and make   appropriate decisions.
Appreciation- 
Appreciating the wonder and beauty of the world and its people
Commitment- 
Being committed to their learning, persevering, and showing self-discipline and responsibility
Cooperation- 
We believe that by working together we will produce quality work and achieve academic excellence  
Creativity- 
Being creative and imaginative in their thinking and in their approach to problems and dilemmas
Curiousity- 
Being curious about the nature of learning and of the world, its people and cultures
Empathy-
 Imaginatively projecting ones self into another’s situation, in order to understand his/her thoughts, reasoning and emotions
Integrity- 
Having integrity and a firm sense of fairness and honesty
Tolerance- 
Feeling sensitivity towards differences and diversity in the world and being responsive to the needs of others
