Riverside Academy East Board of Directors
Every Public School Academy has its own Board of Directors. The Board consists of members of the community, student's parents and outstanding citizens nominated to their positions. The Charter Authorizer approves each Board member after a screening process and background check. The Board of Directors is the governing body of the Academy and they hold monthly meetings to conduct Academy business and resolve important matters. The public is always welcome to attend the meetings. 
All Correspondence for board members may be directed to Riverside West Academy:
